[{"id": 295543352, "title": "We all now have much better conditions to get going because of Exxon, Hess and CNOOC", "text": "Dear Editor,\n\nI start by disclosing that here in Washington, I read our four newspapers daily to try to stay in touch with my Guyana: perhaps, detached from Guyana, I take what\u2019s written and reported in them too seriously. Perhaps, too, out of my training as an engineer, I am too alert to potential or real areas and modes of falling under the load. Five road deaths in 24 hours and 3 drownings the day after, constitute a huge rate of loss to our nation and a cautionary bell. Seems to me, to be a call for us to make things calmer without slowing, as we get on with our living, our rapid growth and development, in a more pleasing and pleasant manner; a call to lower our levels of anxiety, frustration, anger and worry; a call to put aside much that is just riling us up; a call for us to be more courteous and kind to each other, and giving a break to each other.\n\nIt is for such reasons that I felt a need to tell how disturbed I was on reading the Editorial of Tuesday, 25th February, 2025 in Kaieteur News, \u201cWhat about us\u201d, hammering again the misconceived, poisonous allegations of us being cheated and robbed blind by Exxon, Hess and CNOOC. Oh, if the Editor could only recognize how much such articles are contributing to the generation of great anger, frustration and unmet expectations in our society, which are so evident in many of the reports of domestic and other violence, crimes, traffic accidents, and drowning and so on. We need to change that tune: we need to be celebrating, to be joyful and happy with the discovery and rapid development of the oil that was formed off our shores a billion years or more ago. \n\nCan I dare to say that we could be thankful to Exxon, Hess and CNOOC as well as Shell, Total, Hone Oil and CGX and all the others who came before, who over many preceding decades would not have found anything economic, and would have left empty handed?\n\nWhat about us (Guyanese)? Well, we, each of us, have now much better conditions to get going: we, each of us must get going, doing something to improve our future, now. We should be turning ourselves (at least in spirit) into little Exxons, little Hesses and little CNOOCs. Yes, without thinking we can easily feel extorted and cheated, with all that talk about the Exxon consortium receiving billions whilst we are receiving tens of millions, conveniently forgetting that they are paying down billions for each FPSO. From many sides have I seen and lived many of these questions; and I would say as my mother used to tell me \u2013 until you know it is the easiest thing to begrudge others, and count their money without knowing how hard they might have worked and what they might have had to do to acquire and accumulate what they have.\n\nBefore we feel extorted and cheated let us learn how Exxon, Hess, and CNOOC in particular, and the whole oil and gas industry in general, got to where they are today: how the industry was born, grew, evolved and developed. These days we can easily go to Google. I do not think Mr. Hess will object for me to repeat here the story he readily tells about how his father got going. The third son, graduating from secondary school as the great crash of the late 1920s deepened, he could not follow his elder brothers to college, he had to go to work. So, on the first day of his first job he was delivering bags of heating coal on his back to various homes in New York. He turned that beginning into a great start, learning the heating and energy business from the ground up. To keep our own Guyanese end up, I refer similarly to our great Edward Beharry about a few years later, starting off making and selling sweets on the trains then running along our east coast railway. When we look we will find small beginnings at the start of many big things around us.\n\nAlong my 81 years of age, I have learnt that once we start by truly and knowledgeably putting ourselves in the other guy\u2019s/gal\u2019s shoes it is more natural and easier to make friends rather than enemies, and find win-win relationships. I put it that any of us who are not yet on that road can become good friends with Exxon, Hess and CNOOC. Even though I might well be gone by the time we build our nation and make ourselves rich, and prosperous, I encourage us all, everyone, to so endeavour. I know it is challenging \u2013 but we can do it, for it is the direction in which individuals, groups, societies, nations, all human kind, have been treading. \n\nI continue to be thankful to the late Bobby Moore for opening my eyes, in his lively presentation over the late 1950s and early 1960s of that annual GCE \u201cO\u201d Level course, \u201cModern Britain\u201d, to the challenges as well as the sure rewards of great pride to be had in developing and modernizing our country. No doubt his presentations affected many of my generation in our different ways \u2013 Walter Rodney, Tommy Payne, Winston Mc Gowan, and Rupert Roopnaraine. For me, the story of the UK in the lead of Europe, from about 1500, transiting from the traditions of farming with animals to the nuclear bombs at the end of World War II \u2013 that very turbulent pioneering stormy ride through the agricultural and industrial revolutions, and the accompanying economic, social and political revolutions, anyone at times leading and at other times following, and all interacting at all times, was a process we had to get through, ourselves. \n\nPerhaps, it might have been because in the early 1950s, I had been helping in our three acres of rice field, chasing the bulls, helping to move sheaves of paddy cut with grass knives (sickles) whilst seeing tractors and combines appearing in other fields \u2013 that I sensed and longed for us to get on to and along the road of development \u2013 to rapidly catch up with the developed countries, hurrying ourselves in decades through a comparable series of evolving stages of growth which the developed countries took themselves through in centuries. What about us (Guyanese)? We want to be developed rapidly: let us make good friends (not enemies unnecessarily) of Exxon, Hess and CNOOC \u2013 they already know lots that we need to learn, much of it beyond oil. Let us give it a try. I learnt a lot (much of it beyond bauxite and alumina) from the people of ALCAN/DEMBA.\n\nSamuel A A Hinds\n\nFormer Prime Minister and Former President\n\nAmbassador to the USA and OAS", "summary": "Dear Editor,\n\nI start by disclosing that here in Washington, I read our four newspapers daily to try to stay in touch with my Guyana:\u00a0 perhaps, detached from Guyana, I take what\u2019s written and reported in them too seriously.\n\n\nThe article We all now have much better conditions to get going because of Exxon, Hess and CNOOC appeared first on Stabroek News.", "url": "https://www.stabroeknews.com/2025/03/01/opinion/letters/we-all-now-have-much-better-conditions-to-get-going-because-of-exxon-hess-and-cnooc/", "image": "https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2019/06/sn-article-default.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:07:52", "author": "Stabroek News", "authors": ["Stabroek News"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gy", "sentiment": -0.033}, {"id": 295543354, "title": "Financial services sector in dire need of modernization -city chamber", "text": "The financial services sector in Guyana is in dire need of modernisation and financial institutions must streamline updated systems that cater to the evolving needs of Guyana\u2019s growing economy.\n\nThis rebuke was the focus of a release yesterday by the Georgetown Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) as it advocated for change on behalf of the business community.\n\nThe Chamber also express its firm support for the sentiments expressed by Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo on the current state of the financial sector and the need to \u201cdrag it out of the stone ages.\u201d\n\nAccording to the release, the challenges being experienced by the business community which is heavily reliant on the financial sector, includes delays as a result of the paper-based and bureaucratic systems, as well as challenges in access to finance.

Yet many governments are twisting themselves into knots trying to downplay his actions, insisting that things are not as they seem, and that even if they are, confronting the menace in the White House simply is not an option. Disagreement must be carefully disguised to avoid provoking his wrath.\n\nFor the British political establishment, the convenient excuse is the need to preserve the United Kingdom\u2019s \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the United States. Following their White House meeting, both UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Trump reaffirmed their commitment to maintaining it.\n\nThis strategic partnership has been a cornerstone of Britain\u2019s foreign and security policies since 1946, when former Prime Minister Winston Churchill, in a landmark speech in Fulton, Missouri, famously warned that \u201can Iron Curtain has descended\u201d across Europe. In what was arguably the most consequential speech in Britain\u2019s postwar history, Churchill maintained that \u201cneither the sure prevention of war, nor the continuous rise of world organization, will be gained without what I have called the fraternal association of the English-speaking peoples.\u201d To that end, \u201ca special relationship between the British Commonwealth and Empire and the United States\u201d was essential.\n\nAdmittedly, that relationship has always mattered far more to the UK than to the US. Over the years, it has rested on the UK\u2019s ostensibly independent nuclear deterrent, extensive intelligence sharing, military cooperation, and a shared approach to global threats. For many \u2013 including myself \u2013 it has also been defined by deep affection, gratitude, and admiration.\n\nMy lifelong involvement in domestic and international politics has been shaped by an early political baptism in the US, making me an avowed Americanophile. That is why it is so painful to see a US administration fall so far short of the values America has long championed.\n\nSince Churchill\u2019s \u201cIron Curtain\u201d speech, the US-UK relationship has been regarded as the linchpin of the Western-led liberal order. As its undisputed leader, the US has long served as a model for open societies worldwide.\n\nChurchill\u2019s vision of an open society was built on a shared commitment to democratic governance, the rule of law, judicial independence, and resistance to tyranny and oligarchy. It emphasized civility in political life; recognized the moral duty to help the world\u2019s poor and oppressed; and championed the establishment of international organizations dedicated to maintaining world peace, along with defensive alliances committed to upholding international law and self-determination. Crucially, open societies depended on strong economic partnerships, rejecting the kind of protectionism that fueled the Great Depression.\n\nWhile Trump occasionally echoes longstanding US policies, no president has ever played as fast and loose with American values and interests. It is impossible to imagine any of his predecessors inciting an attack on the country\u2019s democratic institutions over fabricated claims of election fraud or pardoning those who stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nLikewise, no US president \u2013 with the exception of Richard Nixon \u2013 used the presidency to exact revenge on their rivals. None of them would have handed a billionaire oligarch like Elon Musk free rein to fire federal workers and dismantle America\u2019s foreign-aid programs. And none was entangled in a web of commercial conflicts of interest as vast and complex as Trump\u2019s.\n\nCertainly, no American president in the past 70 years would have offered Ukraine to Russian President Vladimir Putin on a silver platter, let alone demanded that the Ukrainians hand over their mineral riches to the US.\n\nGiven this reality, Starmer must ask himself whether the UK and Trump\u2019s America still share any values. At the very least, Britain must refuse to be complicit in Trump\u2019s malign policies. That does not mean that the UK should be hostile toward its longtime ally, but it must not debase itself by yielding to Trump\u2019s every demand.\n\nTo mitigate this danger, British policymakers must take four key steps. First, to maintain credibility on Ukraine and address the threat posed by Russian aggression, they must boost defense spending \u2013 as Starmer already plans to do \u2013 despite the UK\u2019s fiscal constraints. They should also collaborate with NATO-aligned EU member states to establish a European rearmament bank.\n\nSecond, although Brexit prevents the UK from leading efforts to secure Ukraine\u2019s accession to the European Union, it should aim to replicate any economic or trade benefits Ukraine gains from EU membership. Policymakers must heed the lesson of the 1930s: appeasing bullies only emboldens them.\n\nThird, British policymakers must remind their American allies that no country \u2013 not even a superpower \u2013 can make itself safe by focusing exclusively on rival major powers. History shows that great-power conflicts often originate in smaller states. Consider Serbia before World War I, Czechoslovakia and Poland before World War II, and Manchuria in the 1930s. As Mark Twain famously put it, \u201cGod created war so that Americans would learn geography.\u201d\n\nFourth, America could use a reminder of the importance of soft power. Strength alone does not inspire genuine support; when a country is viewed as relying on coercion to maintain its dominance, the long-term consequences are likely to be costly.\n\nA Canadian friend once told me he dreads having his accent mistaken for an American one, lamenting that he couldn\u2019t find a lapel pin that reads, \u201cDon\u2019t blame me; I\u2019m from Canada.\u201d I still admire America\u2019s history, culture, and values, but with Trump in power, I am glad my accent sets me apart.\n\nCopyright: Project Syndicate, 2025.", "summary": "By Chris Patten\n\nLONDON \u2013 US President Donald Trump is systematically dismantling the network of multilateral institutions, organizations, and agreements that have helped prevent a third world war for more than 70 years.\n\n\nThe article Britain must downgrade the special relationship appeared first on Stabroek News.", "url": "https://www.stabroeknews.com/2025/03/01/features/project-syndicate/britain-must-downgrade-the-special-relationship/", "image": "https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2025/02/8-6-4.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:01:47", "author": "Chris Patten,Stabroek News", "authors": ["Chris Patten", "Stabroek News"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gy", "sentiment": 0.188}, {"id": 295543346, "title": "Bent Street B, Back Circle B, and Albouystown secure victories on Night Two", "text": "Rock Auto Legends Futsal\n\nThe second night of group stage action in the Rock Auto Legends Futsal tournament saw thrilling encounters at the National Gymnasium, with Bent Street B, Back Circle B, and Albouystown emerging victorious in their respective matchups.

He was expelled from Mexico on Thursday as part of the biggest handover of suspected cartel members in years.\n\nThe violent story of the capo and murdered DEA agent featured prominently in Netflix\u2019s 2018 \u201cNarcos Mexico\u201d series.\n\n\u201cWe have waited 40 years for this day,\u201d Frank Tarantino, the special agent in charge of the DEA\u2019s New York division, told reporters outside the federal courthouse in Brooklyn. \u201cIf you come after us, if you hurt one of us, there is no obstacle we cannot overcome, there is no border we cannot cross.\u201d\n\nCaro Quintero spent 28 years in prison in Mexico over Camarena\u2019s murder. He denies involvement and was released in 2013 on a technicality, but was recaptured by Mexican authorities in 2022. He was indicted in absentia in 2020 in Brooklyn on drug trafficking and weapons charges.\n\nCaro Quintero, 72, landed at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York on Thursday night. On Friday, he appeared in a large ceremonial courtroom packed with more than 100 DEA agents and was led toward the defense table by U.S. marshals, his wrists shackled with the same handcuffs Camarena once carried.\n\nHis lawyer, Michael Vitaliano, entered the not guilty plea on his behalf. U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert Levy ordered him detained pending trial.\n\nMexico\u2019s surprise handover on Thursday of 29 alleged kingpins came amid President Donald Trump\u2019s threats to order 25% tariffs on Mexican goods starting on March 4 over slow progress on stemming fentanyl as well as U.S.-bound migrant flows.\n\nLawyers for many of the defendants accuse the Mexican government of violating their rights with the forced U.S. transfer, since Mexican law mandates that its citizens can only be extradited to face charges in another country if they can be guaranteed not to face the death penalty.\n\nMexico\u2019s Attorney General Alejandro Gertz yesterday said the transfer was legal under Mexico\u2019s national security law. He said Mexico\u2019s prohibition on the death penalty should be respected by other countries.\n\nQuestions over the legality of Mexico\u2019s transfer will not affect Caro Quintero\u2019s case in the United States, legal experts said, due to a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court case finding a Mexican national who was kidnapped and brought north could stand trial even though the U.S.-Mexico extradition treaty was not followed.\n\nThursday\u2019s mass transfer featured mostly aging gang leaders such as Caro Quintero, co-founder of the Guadalajara Cartel, who reigned over Mexico\u2019s criminal underworld decades ago.\n\nSome of those handed over were younger suspected cartel members allegedly responsible for deadly shipments of fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic opioid that has caused nearly half a million U.S. overdose deaths the past decade.\n\nSome other drug lords likely continued to run criminal rackets from behind bars, according to security analysts, but Mexico\u2019s volatile gangland leadership has mostly moved on.\n\nCaro Quintero walked slowly toward the defense table, sporting thick white hair and wearing a blue shirt over an orange undershirt tucked into beige pants, spoke with his lawyer, Michael Vitaliano, and a Spanish interpreter for several minutes before the proceedings began.\n\n\u201cBuenas tardes, senor, good afternoon,\u201d Levy said in both English and Spanish after the case was called.\n\n\u201cBuenas tardes,\u201d Caro Quintero replied.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Saritha Komatireddy said Caro Quintero was responsible both for \u201cgruesome murders\u201d and for the indirect deaths of Americans who used drugs.\n\n\u201cHe and his partners pioneered the Mexican drug trafficking industry,\u201d Komatireddy said in urging Levy to order Caro Quintero detained.\n\nThe White House called Caro Quintero \u201cone of the most evil cartel bosses\u201d on Friday. The statement cited an order issued last month by Trump labeling several Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations.\n\nVicente Carrillo Fuentes, accused by prosecutors of being a one-time Juarez Cartel boss, was also among the group expelled to the U.S. Like Caro Quintero, he also entered a not guilty plea.\n\nKenneth Montgomery, a lawyer for Carrillo Fuentes, said he disputed the idea his client was \u201csolely responsible\u201d for drug-related deaths.\n\nMontgomery said the fact that Carrillo Fuentes was expelled, rather than extradited, \u201cexposes him to penalties that are quite serious,\u201d and then referenced his experience handling death penalty cases.\n\nCarrillo Fuentes and Caro Quintero are due back in court on March 25 and March 26, respectively.", "summary": "NEW YORK,\u00a0 (Reuters)\u00a0&#8211;\u00a0 Alleged drug cartel boss Rafael Caro Quintero, who spent decades in prison in Mexico for the murder of a U.S.\n\n\nThe article Mexico\u2019s Caro Quintero pleads not guilty after shock expulsion to New York appeared first on Stabroek News.", "url": "https://www.stabroeknews.com/2025/03/01/news/regional/mexicos-caro-quintero-pleads-not-guilty-after-shock-expulsion-to-new-york/", "image": "https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2025/02/sat65.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:02:33", "author": "Stabroek News", "authors": ["Stabroek News"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gy", "sentiment": -0.291}, {"id": 295543344, "title": "Two bikers die at Dartmouth following fiery collision", "text": "The police yesterday said that two motorcyclists died following a collision at Dartmouth, on the Essequibo Coast, Region Two.\n\nThis is according to the Traffic Chief, Senior Super-intendent Mahendra Singh.

Nonetheless, I can navigate the currents by sharing how I think observers should be, what could help them manage the shocks of the New Donald Trump Political Season.\n\nFirst, like any new season, expect the unexpected. Many were so geared, but the degree of unpredictability has shaken some folks up. The orthodox went out the door, and in rushed the unorthodox. A torrent of it in wave after wave. Remember: not a single bad word from this side of the ring at this time. To be frank, I see some positives in some of the postures and policies unfolding. There will be no further disclosures at this time. The trick, what puts in a better frame of mind, is to put oneself in a position to think like him, then act like him.\n\nThe power to make things happen is there. The power to make the Democrats disappear, or not being able, to use a cricketing term, to find their length, has its merits. They are still reeling, shaky from the aftershocks, the uphill terrain of their challenges.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is on the move. Anything and anyone standing in its way are sure to be moved. So run and take cover. To change mind, and step forward to be become a new partner. People come to their senses eventually. For good or bad; regarding what was thought of as good before. The what is better or worse today. I have read about a new world order in the making. Scratch out and start over fresh again. It is more in order to say that the magnitude of developments represents the trajectory of the New Donald Trump Order. He has done more than stirred the pot; he has shaken up the whole kitchen. Some like it hot, some like it cold. I think that some of what has been done was long overdue. The jury will come out and give its verdict in due course.\n\nNow let me say this: America, Europe, and the wider world at large, come to think of it, were all due for some radical overhaul. Too much complacency had stepped in, too much of the ordinary had taken hold. The humdrum became the drumbeat. How far should radical go (or not venture), wait until after Lent and 100-day holiday, and I would be in a better place to share a thought or two. Whether I agree or not with what is going on does not matter, really has too little bearing. For now, it is the season of Mr. Trump.

The line started at the gates of the Diamond/Grove Neighbourhood District Council (NDC) and ended at Freshco, on the East Bank Public Road. People were standing, there, under umbrellas, for hours. Some were sitting on bridges, and leaning on fences. During that time, a certain PPP/C government minister attempted to persuade some of the people, there, to go home and return the next day. He told them, that government had extended the deadline until Saturday of this week; citizens remained in the line. Sadly, we continue to see similar disgusting scenes throughout Region 4 and beyond.\n\nAs a citizen of this oil-rich country, I am personally offended by the callous attitude and carelessness of the PPP/C regime towards ordinary Guyanese. This authoritarian regime is literally forcing the working class, seniors, including those with visible disabilities, to suffer public indignity to collect a one-off cash grant of $100,000 of their own money. This gross inefficiency, at the highest level of government, tears into the collective pride of our nation. It demonstrates government\u2019s inability to treat working people with respect and dignity, on the one hand, and governmental laziness, to find a better way, on the other. \n\nIn a stunning show of governmental indifference, the PPP/C administration has managed to turn something as basic as delivering cash grant into a sad spectacle of suffering and indignity for the very citizens it claims to serve. The disbursement of $100,000 cash grants (a measly sum of less than $500 US) is the new low for a government that continues to ignore the needs of the poor and vulnerable. The government\u2019s handling of this grant- forcing citizens to endure long lines, in rain and sun for hours on end- raises worrying questions about its true intentions. Far from being a gesture of goodwill, this disbursement is a tool of political manipulation that is humiliating the population and solidify control over their lives. It is difficult to ignore the sheer indignity that the average Guyanese citizen must endure just to receive their own money. Interestingly, an activity that should have been uplift to our spirits has become obloquy.\n\nLet me make one thing clear, the PPP/C government has created a dehumanising process that forces people to stand for hours in lines, at times, in unbearable weather conditions, only to collect a lagniappe that amounts to next to nothing in a country where inflation and the cost of living are rising exponentially. It is the poor and vulnerable who are subjected to this chaos- those who live pay-cheque to pay- cheque, who depend on every cent they earn, and who should not have to beg for basic government assistance. Meanwhile, the rich and politically connected, those with power and resources, are largely exempt from this humiliation; they can afford to avoid the need for grants altogether. They are shielded from the misery that the rest of the population faces. \n\nIn reality, it is a worrying contrast that reveals the true nature of the PPP/C\u2019s cash grant scheme: it is not about uplifting the poor, but reinforcing the divide between the ruling elite and the rest of the population. For me, this exercise in suffering is less about social welfare and more about securing political loyalty and control. In my view, the PPP/C\u2019s handling of the cash grants is an insult to the people it purports to represent. \n\nAgain, the timing and manner of the disbursement suggest that the government\u2019s real agenda is far from altruistic. The government has found a way to use the desperate need for assistance as a political tool, ensuring that the people are indebted to them for these handouts. It is no coincidence that these grants are being distributed in a highly publicised, highly visible, manner. This is not an effort to improve the lives of the poor, but rather an exercise in ensuring that they are reminded, again and again, of their dependence on the government for their survival. Just look at the way citizens are being photographed at this disgraceful activity. They are being treated as mendicants \n\nThe distribution process itself- long lines, long waits is not just inefficient, it is deliberately designed to create a spectacle. It is a clear tactic to make citizens feel grateful, to elicit a sense of indebtedness, and to foster a sense of political loyalty in exchange for a one- off cash grant. This strategy plays into the PPP/C\u2019s broader pattern of using government assistance to maintain control, with the grant as a temporary tool in the party\u2019s larger game of power consolidation. \n\nIt must be said that what the PPP/C is doing is not just callous; it is calculated, cynical effort to humiliate the poor and make them feel subjugated. The very fact that citizens are made to stand in long lines under the hot sun or pouring rain is a form of political theatre. It reminds them of their position in society- subservient to the whims of the government- and reinforces the idea that they must endure hardship for the bare minimum. I think the fundamental question we need to ask ourselves is why this approach? Why put people though such suffering for a one- time payment that is, frankly, an insult? The answer is obvious enough: to break the spirit of ordinary people and make them believe that their survival depends on government largesse. Clearly, the PPP/C government does not want the people to recognise their own power, to see that their needs and rights should be guaranteed regardless of political affiliations. \n\nRoysdale Forde", "summary": "Dear Editor,\u00a0\n\nLast Monday, just after the Republic Day celebrations, citizens in the Diamond/Grove District showed up to collect their cash grant.\n\n\nThe article Cash grant distribution a spectacle of suffering and indignity appeared first on Stabroek News.", "url": "https://www.stabroeknews.com/2025/03/01/opinion/letters/cash-grant-distribution-a-spectacle-of-suffering-and-indignity/", "image": "https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2019/06/sn-article-default.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:01:44", "author": "Stabroek News", "authors": ["Stabroek News"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gy", "sentiment": -0.64}, {"id": 295543326, "title": "OG Anunoby\u2019s late trey lifts Knicks past Grizzlies", "text": "(Field Level Media) OG Anunoby made a 3-pointer with 5.3 seconds remaining to lift the visiting New York Knicks past the Memphis Grizzlies 114-113 Friday night.

The Ukrainian leader was told to leave, a U.S. official said.\n\nAn agreement between Ukraine and the United States to jointly develop Ukraine\u2019s rich natural resources, which Kyiv and its European allies had hoped would usher in better relations, was left unsigned and in limbo.\n\nEuropean leaders leapt to Zelenskiy\u2019s defense. German chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz said \u201cwe must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war.\u201d\n\nZelenskiy spoke by telephone with French President Emmanuel Macron, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and EU Council President Antonio Costa, an official in the Ukrainian delegation in Washington told Reuters.\n\nBritain is due to host a meeting of Europe\u2019s leaders and Zelenskiy tomorrow to discuss a security backstop to any peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nTrump has lurched toward Russia since taking over as president, shocking traditional allies in Europe and beyond and leaving Ukraine increasingly vulnerable. Yeserday\u2019s outburst was the most public display of that shift.\n\nThe already-tense meeting blew up when Vance stressed the need for diplomacy to resolve the biggest conflict in Europe since World War Two. Zelenskiy, his arms folded, countered that Putin could not be trusted and noted that Vance had never visited Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of diplomacy are you talking about, JD?\u201d Zelen-skiy asked after recounting failed diplomatic efforts with Russia.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about the kind of diplomacy that\u2019s going to end the destruction of your country,\u201d Vance shot back.\n\nZelenskiy openly challenged Trump over his softer approach toward Putin, urging him to \u201cmake no compromises with a killer.\u201d\n\nTrump, whose team said he and Vance were \u201cstanding up for Americans,\u201d quickly took to Truth Social after the meeting to accuse Zelenskiy of disrespecting the United States.\n\n\u201cI have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involv-ed,\u201d he wrote, using an alternative spelling of the leader\u2019s name. \u201cHe can come back when he is ready for Peace.\u201d\n\nTrump later told reporters as he left the White House for a weekend at his Florida home that Zelenskiy needs to realize he is losing the war.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s got to say is, \u2018I want to make peace.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t have to stand there and say \u2018Putin this, Putin that,\u2019 all negative things. He\u2019s got to say, \u2018I want to make peace.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to fight a war anymore,\u201d Trump said.\n\nZelenskiy, asked during an interview by Fox News if his relationship with Trump could be salvaged after Friday\u2019s eruption, said, \u201cYes of course\u201d and appeared to express some regret, adding \u201cI\u2019m sorry for this.\u201d\n\nThe head of the Ukrainian armed forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, posted a statement on Telegram affirming that his troops stood by Zelenskiy and that Ukraine\u2019s strength was in its unity.\n\nAnxious Ukrainians following from afar largely rallied around their leader but fretted about the prospects of continuing flows of U.S. military aid that the country has relied on.\n\nIn Congress, reaction from Trump\u2019s Republican Party was mixed, while Democrats lambasted his handling of the meeting.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader conducted the meeting in his non-native English, and as it progressed he was drowned out by Trump and Vance.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not in a good position. You don\u2019t have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not playing cards, I\u2019m very serious, Mr. President,\u201d Zelenskiy said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re playing cards. You\u2019re gambling with the lives of millions of people, you\u2019re gambling with World War Three,\u201d the U.S. president continued.\n\nFormer Russian President Dmitry Medvedev appeared to revel in the spectacle, writing on Telegram that the Ukrainian leader had received a \u201cbrutal dressing down.\u201d\n\nAfter the talks, Trump directed two top aides to tell Zelenskiy it was time to leave, even as attendants were preparing to serve lunch to the delegations, according to a White House official.\n\nThe Ukrainians were instructed to depart despite their desire to continue the talks, the official added.\n\nThe falling-out meant that Ukraine and the United States failed to sign a much-vaunted minerals deal that Kyiv hoped would spur Trump to back Ukraine\u2019s war effort and potentially win support from Repub-licans in Congress for a new round of aid.\n\nTrump is not interested in revisiting the minerals deal at the moment, a senior White House official told Reuters on Friday evening.\n\nThe clash also undermined efforts by European leaders to convince Trump to provide security guarantees for Ukraine even if he has refused to deploy U.S. soldiers on Ukrainian soil to maintain peace. Such guarantees are seen as crucial to deter Russia from future aggression.\n\nTrump instead threatened to withdraw U.S. support from Ukraine.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re either going to make a deal, or we\u2019re out, and if we\u2019re out, you\u2019ll fight it out. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be pretty,\u201d Trump told Zelenskiy.\n\n\u201cOnce we sign that deal, you\u2019re in a much better position. But you\u2019re not acting at all thankful, and that\u2019s not a nice thing. I\u2019ll be honest. That\u2019s not a nice thing.\u201d\n\nTrump stressed that Putin wants to make a deal.\n\nVance also interjected that it was disrespectful of Zelenskiy to come to the Oval Office to litigate his position, a point Trump agreed with.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t say thank you,\u201d Vance said. Zelenskiy, raising his voice, responded: \u201cI said a lot of times thank you to American people.\u201d\n\nZelenskiy, who won billions of dollars of U.S. weaponry and moral support from the Biden administration, is facing a sharply different attitude from Trump. Trump wants to quickly wind down the three-year war, improve ties with Russia and recoup money spent to support Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI hope I\u2019m going to be remembered as a peacemaker,\u201d Trump said.\n\nEarlier, Trump told Zelenskiy that his soldiers have been unbelievably brave and that the United States wants to see an end to the fighting and the money put to \u201cdifferent kinds of use like rebuilding.\u201d\n\nUkraine has rapidly expanded its defense industry production but remains heavily reliant on foreign military assistance, while also struggling to replenish manpower as it battles a much larger foe.\n\nWhile Ukraine repelled Russia\u2019s invasion from the outskirts of Kyiv and recaptured swathes of territory in 2022, Russia still controls around a fifth of Ukraine and has been slowly taking ground since a failed Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023.\n\nKyiv\u2019s troops hold a chunk of land in Russia\u2019s western Kursk region after a 2024 incursion.\n\nTrump has engaged in a long-distance feud with Zelenskiy in recent weeks, criticizing his handling of the war, calling him a \u201cdictator\u201d and urging him to agree to the minerals deal. He subsequently distanced himself from the \u201cdictator\u201d remark.", "summary": "WASHINGTON,\u00a0 (Reuters)\u00a0&#8211;\u00a0 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s meeting with\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0ended in disaster yesterday, after the two leaders clashed in an extraordinary exchange before the world\u2019s media at the White House over the\u00a0war\u00a0with Russia.\n\n\nThe article Trump and Zelenskiy clash, leaving Ukraine exposed in war with Russia appeared first on Stabroek News.", "url": "https://www.stabroeknews.com/2025/03/01/news/world/trump-and-zelenskiy-clash-leaving-ukraine-exposed-in-war-with-russia/", "image": "https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2025/03/trump-attack-zel.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:03:59", "author": "Stabroek News", "authors": ["Stabroek News"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "gy", "sentiment": 0.015}, {"id": 295543310, "title": "CARICOM Heads gravely concerned over Venezuela\u2019s stated plans to  conduct elections in Essequibo", "text": "CARICOM Heads of Government at their February 19th to 21st summit have expressed grave concerns over Venezuela\u2019s stated plans to conduct elections in Guyana\u2019s county of Essequibo.\n\nIn their Communique issued yesterday, they urged Venezuela not to attempt to carry out elections, or to intrude in any other way, in Guyana\u2019s sovereign territory.\n\nThe Heads also condemned an attack on February 17th on Guyana Defence Force soldiers by armed men from Venezuela.\n\nThe Heads said that they had received an update on developments concerning the Guyana/ Venezuela controversy. \n\n\u201cThey noted with grave concern, both the statements made by the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the Chairman of the National Electoral Council of Venezuela on 27 January, 2025, declaring their intention to conduct elections in the Essequibo region of Guyana on 27 April, 2025 for a `Governor\u2019 and `Legislative Council\u2019 of the so-called `Guayana Esequiba State,\u2019 which Venezuela illegally purported to `annex\u2019 last year.", "summary": "CARICOM Heads of Government at their February 19th to 21st summit have expressed grave concerns over Venezuela\u2019s stated plans to conduct elections in Guyana\u2019s county of Essequibo.\n\n\nThe article CARICOM Heads gravely concerned over Venezuela\u2019s stated plans to  conduct elections in Essequibo appeared first on Stabroek News.", "url": "https://www.stabroeknews.com/2025/03/01/news/guyana/caricom-heads-gravely-concerned-over-venezuelas-stated-plans-to-conduct-elections-in-essequibo/", "image": "https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2025/02/Caricom-meet-comm.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:06:34", "author": "Stabroek News", "authors": ["Stabroek News"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "gy", "sentiment": -0.429}, {"id": 295543312, "title": "Windies U-19 skipper Ramnath grabs 5-13 as T&T hammer Windward Islands in Women\u2019s Super50 Cup", "text": "(SportsMax) Trinidad & Tobago Women secured a comfortable nine-wicket win over the Windward Islands Women in round three of the CG United Women\u2019s Super50 Cup at the St. Paul\u2019s Sports Complex in Basseterre yesterday.\n\nThe Windwards put up a shameful batting performance, being bowled out for just 70 in 33.3 overs after being put in to bat by Trinidad & Tobago skipper Karishma Ramharack.

With all the new hospitals being constructed, the quality of medical services to our people remains low. Yes, we want quality medical care delivered to our people, not more expensive but poorly constructed edifices. My own recent experience sums up why this is my fundamental belief.\n\nIn May 2021, I was unfortunate enough to contract Covid 19. I spent eleven days in the Lilliendaal Hospital. I became non-communicable and went home, and not recovering as I should, I visited several doctors for months without no clear diagnosis. In October 2021, as a last resort, I went to the US, and saw a Trinidadian friend who was a General Practitioner there, not a specialist, and within 24 hours, after the tests he ordered came back, he told me that I have Rheumatoid Arthritis. My RH factor was twice what it was supposed to be. After five months and numerous blood tests for all sorts of irrelevant afflictions, medical practitioners here could not diagnose me. I am certain that our taxes will continue to go to waste, delivering poor health care to our people, in a lot of huge new buildings, the construction of which is riddled with corruption and incompetence. Are we so incompetent as a nation not to see that the cart is pulling the horse? \n\nAnother pet peeve of mine are these huge behemoths we have barreling down our roads. When I go to Trinidad, it becomes immediately apparent that the traffic there is much more organized than it is here. First of all, the mini buses are on special routes and not on the main highways, unlike Guyana. What used to be the old train line there was converted to a special road on which only diplomats, VIPs and the mini buses are allowed, and there is much more order on their roads than here.\n\nOn my last trip there this year, 2025, on the drive from Piarco to Town, I asked the taxi driver where were the huge trucks [we see everywhere in Guyana]. He told me that the 10 ton trucks I was seeing were the big trucks in Trinidad. So I checked the internet and it\u2019s true, the maximum gross weight of any vehicle in Trinidad cannot exceed 15 metric tonnes gross weight, gross, Editor. 5 tonnes of truck and 10 tonnes of load. This means that on our roads, travelling at 65 kilometers per hour, are vehicles with nearly double the Trinidad maximum weight, in load alone! i.e. 30 tons, some even allegedly carry 50 ton loads. Anywhere in Trinidad, if you dig a 3 ft deep hole, you hit solid bed rock, not 800 ft of mud that we have here. So the foundation for roads is very soft here compared to almost everywhere else. Don\u2019t even ask what happens to our narrow ancillary roads, when 30 tonnes of sand is dumped in Kitty, Prashad Nagar, Diamond/Grove, etc.\n\nI\u2019m not even asking who started this madness, what I will ask is now that these things are here, and until we have proper policing of our roads, we should at least assist the police to regulate the traffic properly with signs. The only signs I see are groups of cops stopping traffic to see our documents and causing traffic jams all over the place.\n\nI went to school in Trinidad and I have visited there numerous times. I even drive there, and in Manhattan, New York and downtown Miami, since I lived in Miami for 4 years \u2013 I even had a Miami driver\u2019s license. I have never seen any line of vehicles stopped anywhere to show documents to the police. In the 60 years I have been driving, I have also never seen anything even remotely equal to the traffic situation which has evolved here. Even in America the big trucks cannot occupy the fast lane. In Guyana that would be the right lane. Here, there should be signs, as I see in America and other places, warning that trucks should not be in the fast lane, and they should be restricted to a lower speed than ordinary vehicles or get off the road. I don\u2019t have to say more, every Guyanese understands what they are seeing is total insanity, caused by a police force which has lost all control of the traffic situation here.\n\nThe brand-new Heroes Highway is already damaged by these huge trucks, and I see workers now continuously patching and replacing huge sections of concrete on a road which is less than 6 months old! Weight is only one part of the equation. Travelling at speed increases the road\u2019s ground bearing pressure exponentially. These things are barreling down the road with flashing lights telling the rest of us to get the hell out of the way, and are violating every known traffic law and poses a danger to all of us. Also, it appears our taxes are being used to build parking lots for these huge vehicles, including trailers parked permanently on our roads. If you don\u2019t have a parking area for your truck or heavy duty trailer, which is off of the road, sell it. More than one person has died as a result of trailers without adequate lights or even reflectors parked on the road at night. Fed up.\n\nTony Vieira.", "summary": "Dear Editor,\n\nMy two biggest peeves &#8211; I go every 6 months to Trinidad to see my doctor, a rheumatologist, because we don\u2019t have one here.\n\n\nThe article Quality medical care and traffic insanity are two pet peeves of mine appeared first on Stabroek News.", "url": "https://www.stabroeknews.com/2025/03/01/opinion/letters/quality-medical-care-and-traffic-insanity-are-two-pet-peeves-of-mine/", "image": "https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2019/06/sn-article-default.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:02:39", "author": "Stabroek News", "authors": ["Stabroek News"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "gy", "sentiment": -0.638}, {"id": 295543304, "title": "Ministry to take action against delinquent concrete suppliers", "text": "The Ministry of Public Works (MoPW) in a release yesterday issued a stern warning to suppliers of concrete to contractors on Government of Guyana projects in response to complaints brought by those contractors.\n\nThese issues include: 1) delays in supply \u2013 contractors have made advance payments to concrete suppliers and are then subjected to wait for extended periods of time \u2013 as much as three weeks \u2013 for delivery. 2) Inconsistent quantities \u2013 contractors have complained, supplied evidence and the Ministry of Public Works has since verified that quantities ordered and paid for from concrete suppliers have not been supplied.

One might wonder how we have allowed a system intended to safeguard children to remain plagued by strategies that don\u2019t seem to work. Enter stage right, the latest proposal from the Ministry of Human Services and Social Security (MHSSS)\u2014the establishment of a state-run forensic interview unit. While the intentions behind this initiative may seem exciting on the surface, it must be asked: Is this yet another example of misplaced priorities, where much-needed resources are being directed towards a redundant project, instead of reinforcing the model that is already in place?\n\nThe Child Advocacy Centres (CACs) have been around since 2013, and their track records speak for themselves. These 16 centres around Guyana were created to ensure that child victims of sexual violence receive the care, support, and justice they deserve. Pulling from the Evaluation of UNICEF-Supported Child Advocacy Centres in Guyana report of 2021, it\u2019s noted that the CAC\u2019s with the backing of UNICEF, the European Union, and local NGOs, have provided a beacon of hope for many vulnerable children in Guyana. By offering a one-stop facility where children can receive medical care, legal assistance, and forensic interviews, the centres have significantly improved access to justice and support.\n\nThe government\u2019s new proposal for a forensic interview unit has triggered many questions about the necessity of creating such a body when the CACs already fulfil this very role. These centres, under the careful coordination of trained professionals, have been conducting forensic interviews for years, with remarkable results. They have created safe, child-friendly environments where sensitive interviews can take place, minimizing trauma and improving the accuracy of testimonies. So, why throw money at the creation of a forensic unit when the existing CAC model is already equipped to handle these cases? One can\u2019t help but feel that this push for a new unit is more about the illusion of action than a genuine desire to improve services.\n\nWhat is perhaps most troubling is the fact that the government, under the leadership of Minister of Human Services and Social Security, Dr. Vindhya Persaud, is turning its attention to creating a new unit rather than addressing the glaring weaknesses within the current system. The CACs, while highly effective, face their own set of challenges, namely chronic underfunding and a shortage of staff. It is no secret that the Ministry has struggled to keep up with the demand for child protection services, as evidenced by the severe caseloads of Child Protection Officers (CPOs). As it stands, the ratio of cases to CPOs is staggeringly high\u201490 to 100 cases per officer as was revealed by the Minister herself during her press conference last month. The solution is not more units and more bureaucracy, but rather an investment in the resources, infrastructure, and personnel that will allow the CACs to do their job more effectively.\n\nIn a country like Guyana, where the issues surrounding child abuse are not only urgent but also complex, there is no room for missteps. Yet, when we take a step back and look at the government\u2019s proposed forensic interview unit, it feels like we are heading down the same disastrous path we\u2019ve seen before. Let us not forget the abandoned CAC in Timehri, which remains a white elephant despite its potential. The centre failed due to a lack of proper planning, insufficient resources, and, most importantly, a failure to learn from past mistakes. What guarantees do we have that the forensic interview unit will not suffer the same fate?\n\nThe move towards a forensic interview unit also raises the question: What are the real motivations behind this decision? Is it simply an attempt to appear proactive in the face of public demand for better child protection, or is there a deeper agenda at play? The creation of a new unit would undoubtedly require significant financial investment\u2014resources that could instead be funnelled into expanding the capacity of the existing CACs. This could involve increasing the number of centres across the country, hiring more trained staff, and enhancing training programmes to ensure that professionals in the field are always up to date with best practices. But no, instead of reinforcing what works, we are looking to duplicate services, thus further fragmenting an already overburdened system.\n\nIt is not just the lack of resources that is of concern; it is the failure to learn from past mistakes and apply those lessons to future decisions. The CAC model has proven successful, with tangible results in increasing access to justice for vulnerable children and providing a holistic approach to their needs. If there is a real desire to improve services for child abuse victims, the answer is not more units but greater investment in existing infrastructure. There is no excuse for not providing adequate staff training, ensuring that the necessary personnel are hired, and allocating sufficient resources to meet the needs of children in every region.", "summary": "Child protection in Guyana continues to be weakened through bureaucratic negligence and misallocation of resources.\n\n\nThe article Strengthen Child Advocacy Centres appeared first on Stabroek News.", "url": "https://www.stabroeknews.com/2025/03/01/opinion/editorial/strengthen-child-advocacy-centres/", "image": "https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2019/06/sn-article-default.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:01:42", "author": "Stabroek News", "authors": ["Stabroek News"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gy", "sentiment": 0.222}, {"id": 295543284, "title": "Man crushed to death by truck at Bagotstown", "text": "The police say they are investigating a fatal accident which occurred at about 11.11 am yesterday on the Bagotstown public road, East Bank Demerara.\n\nThe accident involved a motor lorry (#GNN 9248), owned by Toolsie Persaud Limited and driven by Wayne McBean, a 59-year-old resident of Kaneville, EBD, and an identified male pedestrian.\n\nEnquiries disclosed that the lorry was proceeding south along the eastern driving lane of Bagotstown public road when the pedestrian attempted to cross the road from east to west into the path of the lorry and the accident occurred.", "summary": "The police say they are investigating a fatal accident which occurred at about 11.11 am yesterday on the Bagotstown public road, East Bank Demerara.\n\n\nThe article Man crushed to death by truck at Bagotstown appeared first on Stabroek News.", "url": "https://www.stabroeknews.com/2025/03/01/news/guyana/man-crushed-to-death-by-truck-at-bagotstown/", "image": "https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2019/06/sn-article-default.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:05:48", "author": "Stabroek News", "authors": ["Stabroek News"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "gy", "sentiment": -0.065}, {"id": 295543286, "title": "Ministry silent on probe into beating of boy at West Dem Secondary", "text": "Over a month has passed since 14-year-old Kelvin Fraser was attacked by a group of 17 boys at the West Demerara Secondary School, and the Ministry of Education has yet to provide an update on the status of the investigation.\n\nThe family of the victim, frustrated with the slow pace of the inquiry, is still waiting for action and answers.

Greg Abbott, a Republican, signed a bill in 2023 banning gender-transitioning treatment for transgender youth after the measure was approved by the state legislature. The law was challenged in the Texas Supreme Court, with the lawsuit that sought to block the law arguing that the ban has devastating consequences for transgender teenagers who are unable to obtain treatment recommended by their doctors and parents, according to Fox 7. WASHINGTON TEEN REFUSES TO COMPETE AGAINST TRANS BASKETBALL PLAYER, FACES CIVIL RIGHTS COMPLAINT CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But the court upheld the ban last summer in an 8-1 decision.

Swapping Hoops for the Light Blues and vice-versa is a path few would dare to walk but debate often eruprts over best XI\u2019s. Ask a person with a Celtic state of mind and it will be full of Hoops heroes while over the other side of Glasgow, only Rangers players will feature for Ibrox eyes. One Celtic diehard, however, has broken the mould and insisted that he thinks one Rangers player would slot right into the Celtic team under Brendan Rodgers. James Tavernier is coming up on 500 appearances in blue and Steve Evans reckons he\u2019d be a top fit for the Irishman\u2019s side. Evans had Tavernier on loan at Rotherham United from Newcastle United and having seen him first hand, he wonders what life would be like if the right-back had pulled on the Celtic shirt. The Millers boss told the Scottish Sun: \u201cI signed James here as a young man, on loan initially from Newcastle. We were League One trying to get to the Championship. He\u2019s a very lively boy, very confident. \u201cHe was just sensational for us here. It\u2019s not a surprise to me he\u2019s had the career he\u2019s had\u2026talented, technically, magnificent. He\u2019d be good at Celtic, eh? I\u2019ve told him that. Can you imagine him playing in that team?

He\u2019s phenomenal, although defensively he can improve.\u201d Interim Rangers boss Barry Ferguson is full of praise for the captain who is set to hit the 500 mark against Motherwell on Saturday. He said: \u201cFirst and foremost, it\u2019s an unbelievable achievement. \u201cHe\u2019s been through a lot in his Rangers career, but one thing I will say about James Tavernier is that he never hides. He always puts himself out there to play. I thought he was exceptional on Wednesday night vs Kilmarnock when I moved him from his natural right-back position into central defence and he became a real leader. That\u2019s what I want from my captain. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a few good chats and he\u2019s an important player for me. He deserves a lot of credit for 500 games. It\u2019s part of playing at Rangers. When you suffer defeats or don\u2019t play well, it\u2019s generally the captain who gets it in the neck. He\u2019s big enough to handle those situations.

Exactly what this cosmic casing looks like is unknown, but now NASA supercomputers suggest that the Oort cloud may sport two spiral arms, resembling a miniature galaxy.\n\nTo confirm the existence of this structure, scientists will need to track comets and objects originating from the Oort cloud directly, or monitor the light that they reflect, both of which are incredibly difficult tasks. But if they succeed, the findings might offer new insights into where comets come from, how our solar system evolved, and how the Oort cloud impacts our cosmic neighborhood.\n\nDiscover more space news \n\n\u2014Did a supernova 6 million years ago kickstart evolution in Africa?

But exactly why these \"nailed heads\" were created has so-far been a mystery.Archaeologists had two main theories for these remains: the first was that the heads were war trophies designed to intimidate rival communities; the second was that they were created to celebrate the community's ancestors. To test these theories, researchers in Barcelona analyzed seven of the severed skulls from two separate archaeological sites. \"Our premise in approaching the study was that if they were war trophies they would not come from the sites analysed, while if they were venerated individuals, these would most likely be local,\" Rub\u00e9n de la Fuente-Seoane, an archaeologist at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and first author of the study, said in a statement.\n\nUsing strontium analysis \u2014 an element which gets into our bones and teeth and reflects the geography of our diets \u2014 the team concluded that the majority of the skulls at the first site came from nonlocal people, while the majority of those at the second site belonged to members of the local community.

"Two-wheeling it down a country road in WA\u2019s South West makes for a free spirit is how Murray (Muzza) Rudler describes the sensation of riding a vintage motorcycle.\n\nAnd riding with the pack (Bunbury-based Indian Harley Club) adds a volume of orchestrated pitches only found through the tuned exhaust pipes of yesteryear\u2019s motors, from which Murray finds intriguing.\n\nHe is a fan of English pre-world war engineers who before the invention of motorcycles created bicycles, including James Starley who co-founded Starley & Smith of Coventry in 1872, which later was to become the Rudge-Whitworth organisation.\n\nA Wolverhampton mechanic, Dan Rudge, worked British patent quality into his bicycles which produced racing Rudge high bicycles that won world championships.\n\nThe Rudge namesake of quality was eventually badged on the Rudge Company\u2019s first motorcycle catalogue in December 1910 with several desirable features including speed, endurance and reliability.\n\nMany redesigns followed for Rudge that sealed a reputation in the sport of motorcycle racing to booster sales for regular everyday life road commuters.\n\nRudge made the mark at the renowned Brooklands racing circuit on May 12, 1911, when rider Victor Surridge claimed three world records including the first machine under 500cc to achieve more than 60 miles in one hour.\n\nAfter many race wins and production models sold, sadly, in 1943 the Rudge Company was sold off after crippling financial challenges, a drop in sales, and the cost of war being the final straw in building future promising designs.\n\nMurray\u2019s pristine early and rare Rudge multi-bike collection on display at the Bunbury Museum including an early 1911 model, preserves the marque\u2019s history for the enjoyment of the public.\n\nHis wife, Sharon, who shared common vintage motorcycle interest, also has her British 1914 Royal Ruby on display, which was originally sold new to a Donnybrook police officer, before a local farmer took ownership.\n\n\u201cMuzza and I were matched up by friends who also enjoy our passion,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI rode to WA in 1982 from my birth State of NSW on a Kawasaki, and Muzza and I moved to Boyanup in 2003 and rode and enjoyed vintage bikes together ever since.\n\nMurray, 65, who was born in Bunbury, was a mechanic by trade who began his motorcycling at the age of 21.\n\nHis grandparents lived in Boyanup with John Herbert Rudler managing a local winery and Edna (Nana) working at the Boyanup Hotel.\n\n\u201cMy mum said I wasn\u2019t allowed to have a bike, but Dad had a Triumph, which I am trying to track down,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI love nothing more than finding an old bike and get it running in its original unrestored condition.\n\n\u201cI advise people if they have old bikes, get them out and ride because once they retire, it may be too late.\u201d\n\nSharon once told Murray that if he ever said he wanted to play bowls instead of going for a ride, \u201cthey were over\u201d.\n\nA few of Murray\u2019s special rides include a 1936 499cc Rudge Ulster \u2013 crowned with a bronze head and, also a few handmade early Sunbeam marque models \u2013 \u201cthe gentleman\u2019s motorcycle\u201d.\n\n\u201cLuckily, I can pick and choose from many of my bikes I have collected to ride in our Bunbury upcoming annual two-day rally on March 8 and 9 with 234 entries,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRiding early motorcycles requires you to observe what\u2019s going on a kilometre down the road, because some of these old bikes didn\u2019t come with clutches or transmissions and the brakes are limited.\n\n\u201cThat means sometimes hoping off at a slow stop to balance the bike and prepare to get a running start-up.\u201d\n\nAs the Rudlers observe their lives on down the road, getting closer to retirement, they are planning to downsize their collection, well, maybe \u201ckeep at least six of the best\u201d.\n\nSharon said she would like to keep the Ruby for her granddaughter Bonny Brooks, 6, so she can enjoy a ride in the country, the wind in her hair and the wonderful smell of Castrol motor oil.", "summary": "BOB GARNANT with a precious

Emiliana Arango.\n\nThe 30-year-old Saville, who has a career-high ranking of No.20, is set to improve at least 10 places on her current No.121 ranking.\n\nShe had also scored main-draw wins over Marta Kostyuk and Anhelina Kalinina on her way to her first semi-final since the Hobart International in 2024.\n\nHer victory kept the Australian flag flying in Mexico, after teen sensation Maya

the Brumbies walked away from FMG Waikato Stadium with nothing tangible to show for their enterprise and endeavour after suffering a 49-34 loss to the table-topping Chiefs on Saturday.\n\nThe heartbreaker follows a 45-42 defeat to the Western Force in another 12-try extravaganza last Saturday night in Canberra.\n\nThe sapping loss also somewhat soured celebrations for veteran hooker James Slipper, who joined Aaron Smith as Super Rugby's most-capped player with his 185th appearance.\n\nBut there were wide smiles everywhere in the Chiefs camp, none bigger than Gideon Wrampling's after he grabbed a telling second-half try-scoring double with his first two touches of the ball.\n\nThe Brumbies deserved the halftime lead after outscoring the Chiefs three tries to two in the opening section.\n\nAll of the Brumbies' tries, to lock Nick Frost, flyhalf Declan Meredith and speedster winger Corey O'Toole, came out wide after the forwards methodically drew in the Chiefs defence to create opportunities on the edges.\n\nBut two conversions and a penalty goal from Damian McKenzie to go with quickfire tries in the space of three minutes to flyhalf Josh Jacomb and centre Anton Lienert-Brown kept the Chiefs in the game.\n\nThe Chiefs blew the game open with two more quick tries early in the second half, splitting the Brumbies defence right up the middle on both occasions.\n\nFirst livewire centre Quinn Tupaea reeled in his own chip kick, then Wrampling cashed in on a beautifully worked set play from a lineout to cross seconds after joining the fray.\n\nSuddenly trailing 29-15, the Brumbies needed a spark.\n\nInstead they went back to their bread and butter to score from a rolling maul through Lachlan Lonergan.\n\nWhen Andy Muirhead touched down shortly after, following the Brumbies' own lineout on halfway, the scores were all tied up again at 29-all.\n\nBut the deadlock lasted only a matter of seconds after skipper Tupou Vaa'i regained possession from the kick-off and sent Wrampling scampering down the left touchline for his second strike.\n\nAnother Chiefs penalty stretched the home side's lead to beyond a converted try with 10

the significance for the Democratic Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (popularly called Rojava) of imprisoned Kurdish leader Abdullah \u00d6calan\u2019s February 27 call for the disarmament and dissolution of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). \n\nMuslim is a member of the Presidential Council of the Democratic Union Party (PYD).\n\n\u00d6calan's statement is reproduced from LINKS International Journal of Socialist Renewal below the interview.\n\nYou have hailed Mr \u00d6calan\u2019s statement as an \u201chistoric call\u201d that puts the ball in the Turkish state's court and you have said that his freedom is \u201cessential for this historic step to progress\u201d. But how does this impact Rojava? Does Mr \u00d6calan's call for disarmament only refer to the PKK and its armed wing or does it also apply to Kurdish and Kurdish-led freedom organisations in other parts of Kurdistan, such as in Rojava?\n\nThe disarmament is only for the PKK and organisations related to the PKK that are holding arms, inside and outside Turkey, but not the organisations of other political parties in Rojava.\n\nThe war is still going on in Tishrin Dam and Qereqozak and Turkey is directly involved in it by using drones, by shelling and by bombing with F-16 [United States-supplied warplanes]. They should stop these attacks. If they don\u2019t, it will not help the situation in Syria.\n\nIf these attacks continue, we have no other choice but to defend ourselves.\n\nStatement by Abdullah \u00d6calan\n\nThe Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) was born in the 20th century, the most violent century in history. The political and ideological landscape in which the PKK emerged was shaped by two World Wars, real existing socialism, and the Cold War. The denial of the Kurdish reality, especially regarding freedom of expression and restrictions on liberties, created the foundation for its emergence.\n\nThe PKK\u2019s theory, program, strategy, and tactics were heavily influenced by the ideological and strategic framework of twentieth century real socialism. However, the collapse of real socialism in the 1990s due to internal and external factors, the gradual acceptance of identity policies, and developments in freedom of thought led to the PKK gradually losing its original meaning and beginning to stagnate. Like many other historical movements, it has now reached the end of its life cycle and therefore needs to be dissolved.\n\nFor over a millennium, Turks and Kurds have seen the need to remain in an alliance, with the desire to survive and resist hegemonic powers being the dominant driving force. This alliance was built on mutual voluntarism in order to maintain their existence.\n\nHowever, for the past 200 years, capitalist modernity has sought to undermine this alliance. The socio-political forces affected by this transformation have contributed to its deterioration, particularly through the unilateral interpretations imposed by the Republic. The fundamental task today is to restore and reorganise this historic relationship in a spirit of fraternity and unity, without neglecting shared beliefs and values.\n\nThe need for a democratic society is inevitable. The PKK, which is the longest and most comprehensive insurgency in the history of the Republic, found support due to the closure of democratic political channels.\n\nYet, the solutions proposed by the PKK in its various forms \u2014 whether through nation-states, federal unions, administrative autonomy, or purely cultural solutions \u2014 cannot adequately address the deep-rooted historical and social realities of this region as a necessary result of their extreme nationalist drift.\n\nRespect for identities, the right to free expression, and the ability to organise democratically \u2014 allowing every segment of society to shape its own socio-economic and political structures \u2014 can only be realised through the existence of a democratic society and political space.\n\nThe second century of the [Turkish] Republic can only achieve unity and permanence if it is crowned with democracy. There is no viable alternative to democracy as a means of governance and societal organisation. There cannot be another way. Democratic reconciliation is the fundamental principle that must guide this process. Accordingly, the language of peace and democratic co-existence must be cultivated in alignment with this reality.\n\nIn light of the current atmosphere shaped by the call made by [Nationalist Movement Party politician] Devlet Bah\u00e7eli, the will expressed by the President [Tayyip Recep Erdogan], and the positive approaches of other political parties towards this call, I am making a call for disarmament and assuming its historic responsibility.\n\nJust as every contemporary organisation and party whose existence has not been forcibly ended would voluntarily do, gather your congress and take the decision to integrate into the state and society: all groups must lay down their arms and the PKK must dissolve itself.\n\nUndoubtedly, the laying down of arms and the dissolution of the PKK in practice require the recognition of democratic politics and a legal framework.\n\nI extend my greetings to all those who believe in coexistence and who heed my call.\n\n\u2014 Abdullah \u00d6calan.

Families and supporters held vigils outside the shopping centre to honour the victims and demand justice for the corporate and government negligence that caused the tragedy.\n\nReal Plaza, which is a subsidiary of Peruvian conglomerate Intercorp \u2014 owned by Peru\u2019s richest person \u2014 has a history of negligence and poor maintenance of its buildings.\n\nLess than six months after the opening of a Real Plaza centre in 2011 in Arequipa \u2014 a city in the country\u2019s south \u2014 huge concrete blocks detached and fell from the roof and the building flooded.\n\nIn 2019, parts of the roof collapsed at a Real Plaza shopping centre in Juliaca, another city in Peru\u2019s south.\n\nDespite these clear signs of systemic defects in its buildings, Real Plaza did not change its inspection and maintenance protocols.\n\nThe Peruvian government \u2014 essentially acting as the representatives of corporate interests \u2014 is also to blame for the tragedy, by weakening regulations and ignoring public safety concerns.\n\nCongress \u2014 controlled by an alliance of right and far-right parties \u2014 approved a law in October 2023 limiting the ability of local councils to close shopping centres over safety issues. The law mandates that closures must be lifted after a maximum period of 48 hours, even in cases of \u201cimminent danger\u201d.\n\nThe law was a blatant move to protect the profits of the corporations that protest at being forced to close over safety issues, even while being aware of the danger to people.\n\nRight-wing congresspeople introduced a bill in April \u2014 which was eventually voted down \u2014 to extend the validity of building inspection certificates from two years to 10.\n\nIn December, right-wing congressperson Adriana Tudela introduced a bill to make inspection certificates\u2019 validity indefinite, meaning that shopping centres would never be obliged to re-certify the safety of their buildings. She only withdrew the bill following the most recent tragedy in Trujillo.\n\nThe inspections are merely a formality anyway, when since 2018 they do not require a civil engineer to be present \u2014 a change made by the government to \u201creduce costs\u201d and \u201csimplify processes\u201d.\n\nThe day before the collapse, workers at the shopping centre reported \u201cstrange noises\u201d coming from the building, but operations continued normally.\n\nFollowing the tragedy, Real Plaza\u2019s failed to take responsibility, and instead peddled lies and deflections.\n\nReal Plaza claimed that they had contacted all of the families of the victims that died or were hospitalised were disproved by families revealing that, even days after the tragedy, they had not been contacted.\n\nThe company also claimed it was covering all the medical costs of victims, but one survivor said he was only offered a paltry 1200 soles ($521) to cover his treatment.\n\nThe tragedy sparked the widespread closures of Real Plaza shopping centres, along with many others across the country, due to safety concerns.\n\nThe local council in Huancayo closed the city\u2019s Real Plaza shopping centre for 30 days due to the roof\u2019s structural problems and other safety issues.\n\nThe tragedy in Trujillo, and the following wave of building closures, highlights the extent of government corruption and

Here's how to watch WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 online and on TV, and from anywhere with a VPN.\n\nWWE Elimination Chamber 2025 start time and date\n\n\u2022 Date: Saturday, March 1\n\u2022 Start time: 6:30 p.m. ET / 3:30 p.m. PT / 11:30 p.m. GMT / 10:30 a.m. AEDT (Sunday)\n\u2022 U.S. \u2014 Watch on Peacock\n\u2022 RoW \u2014 Watch on Netflix \n\u2022 Watch anywhere \u2014 try NordVPN 100% risk-free\nFor several years now, WWE Elimination Chamber has been a pivotal step on the famed Road to WrestleMania. And that's no different here in 2025, with several hefty WrestleMania spots up for grabs at this latest WWE Premium Live Event.\n\nWhere it pertains to the men's Elimination Chamber, six men compete to earn themselves a shot at WWE Champion Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 41. For the six women likewise going through the brutality of the Chamber, their prize is an opportunity at the Women's World Championship currently held by Rhea Ripley.\nWhile those Elimination Chamber matches are clearly the headline attraction at Toronto's Rogers Center, they're far from the only thing on offer, with forever rivals Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn going to unsanctioned war, and WWE Hall of Famer Trish Stratus once again lacing up her boots as she teams with WWE Women's Champion Tiffany Stratton.\nWith that said, here's our full guide to where to watch WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 live streams online and on TV around the world today.\nHow to watch WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 live streams from anywhere\nWhile Peacock is available all across the U.S. and Netflix is now the standard around the world, WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 live streams can get a bit confusing. You might want to check out a VPN if you're abroad can't watch with the service you normally use.\nWe've tested many different VPN services and our favorite is NordVPN; it offers superb speeds, excellent customer service and a no-questions-asked 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can try it out first to see if it's right for you. But you've got other VPN options too, so check out our full list of the best VPN services.\n\nExclusive deal\nThere's a good reason you've heard of NordVPN. We specialize in testing and reviewing VPN services and NordVPN is the one we rate as the best. It's outstanding at unblocking streaming services, it's fast and it has top-level security features, too. With over 7,000 servers, across 110+ countries, and at a great price, it's easy to recommend.\nGet 70% off NordVPN with this deal\n\nHow to watch WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 live stream in the U.S.\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\nWWE Pemium Live Events like WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 are exclusively streamed on Peacock in the United States. They are included in both the Premium and ad-free Premium Plus tiers of the streaming service.\nHowever, even if you\u2019re subscribed to the ad-free option, it won\u2019t make a difference since commercials are still included in live WWE productions.\nPeacock plans start at $7.99 per month, and the annual Peacock plan is $79.99, which essentially gives you two months free.\nSubscribed to Peacock but traveling over the weekend? You can use a VPN such as NordVPN to access your domestic streaming services from anywhere.\n\nIn addition to the WWE live streams, Peacock also has huge library of licensed content drawn from various brands. That includes shows such as \"Love Island USA,\" \"The Office,\" \"Law and Order: SVU and \"Real Housewives\" and movies like \"Oppenheimer.\"\n\nHow to watch WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 live streams in U.K., Canada and Australia\nFor wrestling fans in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and various other countries outside of the United States, they can watch WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 live on Netflix, the new home of WWE around the world.\nTraveling in the U.S. and don't want to pay for Peacock? You can use NordVPN to access your Netflix subscription from anywhere in the world.\n\nCM Punk is looking to earn his first WrestleMania main event. (Image credit: Netflix)\nWWE Elimination Chamber 2025 card, predictions and storylines\n\nTag Team Match: Trish Stratus & Tiffany Stratton vs. Nia Jax & Candice LeRae\nUnsanctioned Match: Kevin Owens vs. Sami Zayn\nElimination Chamber Match: Alexa Bliss vs. Bayley vs. Bianca Belair vs. Liv Morgan vs. Naomi vs. Roxanne Perez\nElimination Chamber Match: CM Punk vs. Damien Priest vs. Drew McIntyre vs. John Cena vs. Logan Paul vs. Seth Rollins\nComing from Toronto's Rogers Center, WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 is the final Premium Live Event ahead of WrestleMania 41. And in that regard, this latest PLE has some huge implications for this year's Showcase of the Immortals.\nTo earn a shot at Cody Rhodes and the WWE Championship, CM Punk, Damien Priest, Drew McIntyre, John Cena, Logan Paul, and Seth Rollins do battle in the men's Chamber match. Cena is the sentimental favorite as he continues his retirement tour of 2025, with this purportedly the final chance for WWE to have John Cena vs. Cody Rhodes at a WrestleMania. Away from Big Match John, CM Punk seems like the next-best bet to emerge victorious here, although you can't totally rule out a Drew McIntyre or Seth Rollins win either. And who knows, maybe WWE swerves us all and gives Damien Priest or Logan Paul the nod to face the American Nightmare at 'Mania.\nSpeaking of Cody, Elimination Chamber will see the second-generation star give an answer to The Rock where it relates to his \"soul\". The Final Boss' recent SmackDown appearance suggests that he wants Rhodes to be his own corporate champion, and it may well be that Rocky has someone else in mind for that role should Cody turn down that offer.\nIn the other Elimination Chamber contest, a shot at the Women's World Championship is on the line. While Rhea Ripley currently holds that title, the Eradicator defends the gold against Iyo Sky on the Raw after Elimination Chamber, meaning it's not a complete lock that the winner of the women's Chamber will be facing Ripley. Whereas John Cena and CM Punk are the standout options for the men's match, things aren't quite so clear for the women. When looking at the competitors, they all seem to have other things in place for WrestleMania 41. For example, Liv Morgan has just become one-half of the WWE Women's Tag Team Champions; Bianca Belair and Naomi seem destined to do something involving Jade Cargill and the mystery behind who attacked Jade late last year; Alexa Bliss likely has the Wyatt Sick6 in her future; and WWE could easily pair Bayley and Roxanne Perez up against one another at WrestleMania. As such, the women's Elimination Chamber is way more unpredictable than the men's right now.\nAway from those Elimination Chamber matches, the heated rivalry between Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn has once again been reignited for these on-off best friends. While Raw General Manager Adam Pearce refused to make Owens vs. Zayn official, he instead gave the bout the green light to be an unsanctioned no-holds-barred war. After KO turned on Sami by dropping him with a Package Piledriver a few weeks ago, the pair have since turned up at each other's homes as this situation becomes increasingly personal.\nWhile Owens and Zayn are guaranteed a hero's welcome in their home country of Canada, that will also be the case for hometown Hall of Famer Trish Stratus as she teams up with WWE Women's Champion Tiffany Stratton. Stratus and Stratton go up against the monstrous Nia Jax and her latest sidekick Candice LeRae - with Charlotte Flair likely to be watching on ahead of facing Tiffy at WrestleMania 41.\nMore from Tom's Guide\n\nBest streaming VPN\nHow to watch F1 live streams\nHow to watch WWE from anywhere\n\nWe test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses.

Auston Matthews stole the puck, made a move to the left side of the crease and slid it over to Knies, who snapped a 2-2 tie by sliding the puck into the open right side of the net before Shesterkin could cover in time.\n\nOliver Ekman-Larsson scored a power-play goal early in the first period and William Nylander tallied on a fortuitous bounce in the opening minute of the second as the Maple Leafs won their fourth straight game.

Since its beginnings in 1973, the event has expanded in tandem with the growing Dutch passion for darts, a surge largely attributed to the triumphs of Raymond van Barneveld and Michael van Gerwen . Today, it stands as an impressive showcase, eclipsing the UK Open in participant numbers, with thousands entering the fray in men's and women's singles and pairs, alongside youth categories. Yet, it's not only the sheer volume of competitors that sets the Dutch Open apart - the fans also play a crucial role, flocking in droves to witness the elite talent that makes it to the quarter-finals. Dutch darts icon Vincent van der Voort, a PDC mainstay from 2011 to 2024 and a UK Open finalist in 2007, shared his thoughts on this must-see event now under the World Darts Federation's purview. \"It is a little bit different,\" said Van der Voort, speaking at the MODUS Super Series 24/7 launch on Pluto TV \"You see, the Dutch Open has 4,000 entries. Singles tournament. England has more darts players than Holland. They don't go to one tournament like that. \"For some reason, we do it differently. Because the British Open has probably 200 entries. That's weird, isn't it? In Holland, 4,100 is something like 4,000. So we do something different. But what, I don't know. \"If you are a darts player, you want to be there once in your life to see what's going on. They've got a party tent. All idiots are in there just having a good time the whole weekend through. It's just amazing.\" \"You play your first round. You have to wait four or five hours to play your second round,\" added Van der Voort, who aims to play on the Super Series in 2025, with free-to-air coverage provided by Pluto TV. \"There's no other tournament in the world that happens.\" Darts legend Van Barneveld made his mark at the Dutch Open during his BDO days, securing the title thrice - in 2001, 2004, and 2006 - with one victory against Gary Anderson. Other prominent players such as Andy Fordham, Wayne Mardle, and Jocky Wilson also participated. In the women's game, young Beau Greaves has already bagged two titles, asserting her dominance on the WDF circuit by winning in both 2022 and 2024, reports the Mirror . The 2025 edition of the Dutch Open saw a massive turnout of 4600 competitors across various categories, with the event unfolding from late January to early February.", "summary": "The World Darts Federation-organised Dutch Open is the biggest open darts tournament in the world, with thousands of players of all ages from across the globe entering", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/other-sports/darts/dutch-open-darts-gary-anderson-34771187", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/article34771183.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_DARTS-FANS1jpeg.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:30:00", "author": "Ben Crawford", "authors": ["Ben Crawford"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.392}, {"id": 295549426, "title": "\u2018Isn\u2019t he injured?\u2019: Panther\u2019s Vegas antics raise eyebrows", "text": "Request failed, with status codes original_status: 504 and pc_status: 504.

Get your first month for just $1. Limited time offer.\n\nNow, in his 12th season coaching the club, he burns to win a title as the coach, the New York Post reports. \n\n\u201cI\u2019d give one back to win one as a coach,\u2019\u2019 Stuart told The Post after running his team through a 90-minute training session in advance of the Raiders matchup with the New Zealand Warriors in a game that will be televised by Fox. \n\n\u201cYeah, we won three grand finals when I was playing, but you\u2019d give one back to bring one now. That\u2019s obviously an ultimate goal of mine.\u2019\u2019 \n\nStuart is one of the true characters among the teams here this week.\n\nHe\u2019s stocky with a rock-solid build, even at 58.\n\nHe\u2019s no-nonsense, with a soft side as well, partially as a result of having an autistic daughter who he calls \u201cthe boss\u2019\u2019 and said changed his life. \n\n\u201cPeople that know him know he\u2019s just pure passion,\u2019\u2019 Raiders star Joseph Tapine told The Post. \n\n\u201cHe cares about the club, cares about our game. He\u2019s emotional because he cares so much, and that\u2019s why people probably appreciate him a lot more, especially me as a player playing under him.\u2019\u2019 \n\nAs a player, Stuart was known by NRL followers as one of the all-time trash talkers.\n\n\u201cHe looked like he was a cheeky fella when he was playing,\u2019\u2019 Tapine said with a grin. \n\n\u201cI always said if I played against him, I\u2019d want to try to take his head off. He trash-talks now and he\u2019s not even playing. He\u2019s a bit of a piss.\u2019\u2019 \n\nA true measure of Stuart\u2019s passion is the fact that, unlike almost every one of the rugby league coaches who coach from a coaches\u2019 booth (like NFL offensive co-ordinators almost always do), Stuart coaches from the sideline. \n\nBecause he wants to be in the middle of it. Plus, it\u2019s difficult to talk trash to the opposing team from a coaches\u2019 booth. \n\nThree years ago, the intense Stuart experienced a moment somewhat like what former Giants coach Tom Coughlin went through when the team\u2019s brass let him know they needed him to lighten up his austere approach. \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I was intense until everybody told me I was,\u2019\u2019 Stuart said. \n\n\u201cLook, I just want to win. I know they [the players] want what I want and I want what they want. \n\n\u201cAnd sometimes it\u2019s the hungriest bloke that gets it. That\u2019s in my DNA.

Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico, who in 2018 served as the chair of House Democrats' campaign arm.\n\n\"The town halls, people coming forward, showing up in communities all across America, filling the phone lines here in Washington, D.C.,\" Luj\u00e1n continued, \"I think you can draw a direct comparison to the outcome of what happened in 2018.\"\n\nIn the early weeks of President Donald Trump's second term, Democrats labored to pick their political targets amid a near-daily barrage of executive orders and moves by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to defund and dismantle federal programs and fire government employees. But in the prospect of cuts to Medicaid, which covers more than 70 million Americans, they see a clarifying issue that they hope can help them capture the same kind of energy that catapulted them back to power in 2018.\n\n\"The American people were upset in 2005 when Republicans tried to privatize Social Security. The American people were upset in 2017 when Republicans tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act,\" Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the Democratic leader, said in an interview, citing two campaign cycles in which his party wrested back control of the House under a Republican president. \"The American people are very upset right now, including in the communities I represent, about the Republican effort to take away their health care and enact the largest cut to Medicaid in our country's history.\"\n\nHe said Democrats would continue to hammer away at the \"clear contrast\" that they emphasized in the past to maximum political advantage.\n\nThey are already putting money behind the message. House Democrats' political action committee announced Friday that it had bought advertising time in over 20 districts across the country savaging Republicans for opening the door to $880 billion in Medicaid cuts.\n\n\"They claimed they'd lower costs,\" the narrator says. \"Instead, Trump and Speaker Johnson are set to kick millions off of health insurance.\"\n\nIn 2017, protesters swarmed Republican town halls across the country and urged their lawmakers not to vote to replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"When it comes to health care, all politics is personal,\" Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, said in 2018 the day after her party reclaimed the House. \"We made our own environment. While the GOP tried relentlessly to distract and divide, our candidates kept their focus on that subject.\"\n\nSimilar scenes have played out in recent days as lawmakers have been pressed by their constituents on the scope of Trump's budget cuts. In both cases, Republicans have dismissed the protests as being coordinated by liberal activist groups and argued that the protests are not representative of average voter sentiment.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nStill, Republicans who have witnessed some of the backlash firsthand are already warning their colleagues to adjust their messaging.\n\nRep. Rich McCormick of Georgia had constituents shout, jeer and boo at him at a recent town hall where he faced questions about the firings of federal workers and the Musk team's access to taxpayer information.\n\n\"We have a message that's about saving Medicaid, Medicare,\" McCormick said, referring to Trump's promises not to touch either program. \"But you can lose that message with one attitude, and if nothing else, we have to be careful how we message this so it doesn't come across as dispassionate.\"\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nOne of the Republicans who ultimately opposed the repeal effort, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, said she saw parallels between the 2017 push and current attempts to cut Medicaid.\n\n\"I feel like we are going back to the days of the ACA when I was trying to explain to colleagues how Alaska was so disproportionately impacted,\" Murkowski said.\n\nHouse Republicans have yet to write legislation laying out specific spending reductions and tax cuts that would fulfill their budget plan. Speaker Mike Johnson has insisted in recent days that they want to find \"efficiencies\" in Medicaid -- \"not cutting benefits for people who rightly deserve that.\"\n\n\"You don't want able-bodied workers on a program that is intended, for example, for single mothers with two small children who's just trying to make it,\" Johnson said in an interview on CNN. \"That's what Medicaid is for. Not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.\"\n\nHe said Republicans would not fundamentally change the structure of the program, as some conservatives have long proposed, and would not establish a cap on federal funding for Medicaid.\n\nMany Republicans are comfortable with establishing work requirements for the program, but that change is estimated to save only around $100 billion. House Republicans' budget plan requires the committee that oversees Medicaid and Medicare to find more than eight times that in savings.\n\nGetting to that number, even among Republicans, will be extraordinarily politically fraught. And because many states have expanded their Medicaid programs under the Affordable Care Act, doing so is likely to affect a broad swath of the population in states around the country.\n\n\"I'm not going to vote for Medicaid cuts,\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who was elected in 2018. \"Work requirements are fine, but 21% of the residents in my state receive Medicaid or CHIP,\" he said, referring to the program that provides health coverage options for children whose families earn too much to qualify for Medicaid.\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nOne of the Republicans who will almost certainly be squeezed in the process is Rep. David Valadao of California, who represents a district where almost 2 in 3 people rely on Medicaid.\n\nSince he was elected to Congress in 2012, he has won reelection in every cycle but one -- in 2018.\n\nBefore he voted to approve the GOP budget resolution this week, Valadao rose on the House floor to lay out the stakes of potential cuts -- and to deliver his party leaders a warning. Achieving $880 billion in budget cuts, he said, \"is not an easy task.\"\n\n\"I've heard from countless constituents who tell me the only way they can afford health care is through programs like Medicaid,\" Valadao continued, \"and I will not support a final reconciliation bill that risks leaving them behind.\"\n\n\"Medicaid cuts,\" he said, \"are deeply unpopular with the American families who sent us here to deliver on President Trump's agenda.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.", "summary": "WASHINGTON -- In 2018, Democrats won back the House, flipping 41 seats including in conservative-leaning places like the suburbs of Utah and Oklahoma by focusing narrowly on a single issue: Republican efforts to overturn a popular health care program, the\u2026", "url": "https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/democrats-see-political-opening-in-gop-budget-as-republicans-eye-medicaid-cuts/article_a53a461b-ab40-5fa1-96e7-b88377e08bea.html", "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:03:03", "author": "Blox Content Management,Catie Edmondson", "authors": ["Blox Content Management", "Catie Edmondson"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.27}, {"id": 295549142, "title": "Why Do SUVs Look Like Trucks Again?", "text": "Before the world heard of \"sport utility vehicles,\" they were called trucks: Jeeps, Land Rovers and Fords, many born as military vehicles, as square-jawed and capable as a drill sergeant.\n\nFor decades, though, consumers gravitated to so-called crossover SUVs, built on the bones of passenger cars, with soft curves and gentler manners suited to suburban lifestyles.\n\nBut now, in the cyclical way that the padded shoulders of the 1980s are on today's Paris runways, a right-angled style has become a leading trend even among mainstream SUVs. And a new wave of rugged electric off-roaders is defying the old fuel-guzzling formula.\n\nThe signature boxy style of the Mercedes-Benz G-Class has helped make it a global status symbol, driven by celebrities such as Drake, Simone Biles and Kim Kardashian, or by Russian oligarchs in armored trim. The Land Rover Defender, Britain's postwar answer to the Jeep, has enjoyed a global sales resurgence after its star turn on the Netflix show \"The Crown.\" Toyota's redesigned Land Cruiser traces its roots to a model the company conceived in 1950 to back up America's Jeeps on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nCritics may dismiss these trucks as Tonka toys for city slickers who rarely muddy their wheels. But as traditional cars fade, including luxury sedans, SUVs with genuine heritage and all-terrain skills have never been more popular.\n\n\"You've got a number of folks who loved these vehicles, and then they kind of disappeared,\" said Alexander Edwards, president of Strategic Vision, a market research company. \"As Hollywood could tell you, nostalgia can generate big revenues, if it's done authentically.\"\n\nThe Ford Bronco, a canny update to a charming '60s-era surf wagon and four-by-four, generated 190,000 orders at its 2021 debut. Paul Wraith, the British chief designer of the Bronco, said its rectilinear forms were rooted in traditional function, including an upright windshield and short body overhangs for climbing perilous grades and obstacles without damage. Like the original, the Ford features easy-to-remove doors and roof panels for open-air fun.\n\n\"That appearance is the 'U' in SUV,\" Wraith said.\n\nThe 'Van Life' Effect\n\nWith the steel frames of pickup trucks, fuel-thirsty engines and bare-bones cabins, these outdoorsy models once seemed antiquated compared with car-based SUVs. For instance, the Jeep Wrangler, the scion of heroic World War II Jeeps, was struggling in the mid-2000s. But by 2018, sales tripled, to 240,000 units, as the Jeep became more versatile and civilized. A plug-in hybrid Wrangler is among today's top-selling versions.\n\nSeveral mainstream SUVs are now playing up traditional truck looks, adopting sharper creases and a more rugged vibe. Sales of the Toyota RAV4 have risen since it adopted a brawnier design in 2019. That included 475,000 buyers in 2024, more than any SUV in America. The 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe ditched generic curves for a boxy silhouette that cribs shamelessly from Land Rover, winning sales and critical plaudits.\n\nExperts say some buyers grew bored of crossovers, whose generic curves made them easy to lose in a parking lot. By contrast, these trucks are identifiable from 50 yards away.\n\nAnother factor was the pandemic, which set off an explosion of interest in hiking, biking and other outdoor pursuits, Edwards said. Work-at-home Americans migrated from big cities and had time, money and a renewed interest in splurging on recreational vehicles, including vans for \"van life\" travel and these four-wheel-drive trucks.\n\nIf modern cars are becoming smartphones on wheels, these SUVs are chunky rotary-dial models: analog, tactile and comfortingly familiar. Despite offering the latest creature comforts, they tend to be light on screens. Many play up old-school physical controls that other cars have jettisoned: industrial-strength shift levers, oversize knobs designed for larger hands, outdoorsy materials and utilitarian design cues. Many consumers, fed up with digital overload, say they would like those controls back.\n\nMasculine, Not Too Aggressive\n\nIf any model symbolizes the ultimate victory of the SUV, Edwards said, it is the Mercedes G-Class, or Gel\u00e4ndewagen. Built in Austria, it was conceived in 1979 as an unpretentious military or farm truck.\n\nMercedes didn't initially offer the G-Class in America, and a gray market of imports stoked demand. The federal government cut off imports in 1987, making the Mercedes 3 tons of forbidden fruit. The automaker finally brought the model stateside in 2003, where it evolved into a sumptuous luxury SUV that can still perform off-road.\n\nJessica Hart, founder of the Luma Beauty brand and a former model, adores the G-Wagen she bought when she moved to Los Angeles, after 17 car-free years in New York. She has the AMG G 63, a prized version from Mercedes' performance division.\n\n\"The boxy design is masculine but not overly aggressive,\" said Hart, who grew up around farms in Australia with the nation's iconic \"utes\" oddball mashups of a sports sedans and pickup trucks.\n\n\"I'm a bit of a rev-head, so the engine is worth it for me,\" Hart said.\n\nThe G-Class has managed to clamber over the S-Class, the limo-like sedan that had been Mercedes' benchmark brand, in both sales and image. Mercedes sold nearly 11,000 G-Classes last year, quadruple its sales from a decade ago. S-Class sales continued to wither, down 25% last year from the year before, to 8,800 cars. The explosive sales gains of the G-Class seem more striking in light of its average price, $192,000, according to surveys conducted by Strategic Vision, compared with $131,000 for a typical S-Class.\n\n\"G-Class buyers don't even blink at the price,\" Edwards said.\n\nAmong all G-Class owners surveyed, the median household income was $827,000, and 42% cited income of more than $1 million. That is nearly double the $425,000 for S-Class households. (Luxury-car buyers overall report $182,000 in household income.)\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nFor all its sales and cultural success -- including being the pope's longtime ride -- the G-Wagen's brazen attitude and social connotations also make it a conspicuous target. Critics deride it as a safari-clad cosplayer, a serious truck reduced to a lifestyle accessory.\n\nMercedes executives acknowledge that only a small percentage of G-Class owners venture off-road. But experts say all these models must protect their bona fides. Outdoors fans who rely on four-wheel-drive trucks are keenly attuned to their capabilities, and pounce on models viewed as pretenders.\n\n\"If these vehicles couldn't climb a speed bump, and handle off-road driving, they would be dismissed,\" Edwards said. \"If the truck is a poser, then I'm a poser.\"\n\nHart has taken her Mercedes off-roading at Sonoma Raceway. But she knows that when spiffed up, the SUV also makes a citified social statement. Weeks ago, Hart installed new forged wheels on her baby, in a custom shade of lavender to match her Phoebe Philo handbag that she'd obsessed over.\n\n\"My G-Wagen is also like jewelry, an extension of you and your personal style,\" she said.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nSome nostalgic models are now going electric, aiming to boost off-road skills without running roughshod over the environment. Mercedes' electric 2025 G-Class can wade through 34-inch-deep water, and spin in place like a military tank. Range Rover and Jeep are readying battery-powered models. General Motors' GMC Hummers have switched to electric power, seeking to rehabilitate a tarnished image. And Tesla's polarizing Cybertruck is a crudely triangulated take on the boxy formula.\n\nVolkswagen Group's partnership with the Silicon Valley startup Rivian underscores what's at stake in this lucrative market. The leading-edge technology of Rivian's electric \"adventure trucks\" led VW to take a 50% stake in a new $5.8 billion joint venture. VW also plans to integrate Rivian's technology into an ambitious revival of the Scout brand, long-defunct trucks built by International Harvester. The strategy seems clear: With no American off-road heritage of its own, VW is looking to buy one instead.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.", "summary": "Before the world heard of \"sport utility vehicles,\" they were called trucks: Jeeps, Land Rovers and Fords, many born as military vehicles, as square-jawed and capable as a drill sergeant.", "url": "https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/why-do-suvs-look-like-trucks-again/article_301d7fe3-ee30-52c4-8e47-cab5cce11b25.html", "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 05:59:34", "author": "Blox Content Management,Lawrence Ulrich", "authors": ["Blox Content Management", "Lawrence Ulrich"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.378}, {"id": 295549138, "title": "Gene Hackman's Gritty, Grouchy, Old-School Style", "text": "(Appraisal)\n\nIn the decades separating the suave Cary Grant from the willowy Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, there was a leading man with a rougher kind of charm.\n\nEven in his box-office heyday, Gene Hackman had a receding hairline and a paunch. He could pass for 50 when he was 30. He described himself as a \"big lummox kind of person.\"\n\nHis first noteworthy role came alongside Jean Seberg in the 1964 film \"Lillith.\" Seberg said she found Hackman handsome because his face had so much character to it -- but she didn't believe he would go very far in an industry that favored Warren Beatty and other more conventionally attractive men.\n\nBut changing attitudes demanded a new kind of star, and Hackman arrived when the sharp-focus cinema of the midcentury years gave way to the grainier palette of the 1970s, a time when the line between hero and antihero was blurring.\n\nHe was 40 when he had his first leading role, in the drama \"I Never Sang for My Father.\" The next year he put on a porkpie hat to play the vicious cop Popeye Doyle in \"The French Connection,\" a performance that won him the first of his two Oscars.\n\nIn keeping with his Midwestern upbringing, he was modest and polite, but he was not always able to keep his anger in check. He had a habit of arguing with film executives, producers and directors -- anyone in a position of authority.\n\nNews of his death came during a week when the nicely coifed movie stars of the social media age were glad-handing their way through the final rounds of an expensive and elaborate Academy Awards campaign. Suddenly, the irascibility at the heart of Hackman's work and persona seemed like a relic of the days when actors were not so eager to smile on cue, not so willing to play the game.\n\nHe had a leading role in \"The Poseidon Adventure,\" one of the biggest blockbusters of the 1970s, but he tended to disparage the film in interviews, and he turned down a chance to take part in a planned sequel, even when he was offered a nice payday.\n\nHe recounted the story of his refusal on a 1974 episode of \"The Tonight Show.\" Seated next to Johnny Carson, who took drags now and then from a cigarette, Hackman was the very model of the '70s-style leading man, with his unkempt sideburns, thinning hair, thick mustache, wide-lapel blazer and undone brown collared shirt as he made fun of the movie-industry executives and their crackpot plan. \"They called me,\" he said, \"and I said, 'Well, yeah, but I got killed in the last five minutes of the film.' 'Well, we'll get around it.' I said, 'I don't think so.'\"\n\nWhile making \"The Package,\" a forgettable 1980s thriller, he angrily delayed a nighttime shoot on the streets of Chicago because of what he perceived as a flaw in the script. His character, an expert marksman, was called upon to fire his weapon nine times at a fleeing bad guy. With the temperature near zero, he got into an extended debate with a producer, arguing that his character was too skilled with a gun to keep missing like that.\n\nHis obstinacy, integrity and occasional storminess bled into his characters and became a major part of his appeal, making him an alluring figure to moviegoers unstirred by Beatty or another classic leading man of the time, Robert Redford.\n\nHis life experience further set him apart from his hunkier rivals. He worked in a steel mill one summer during his high school years and enlisted in the Marine Corps at age 17. After putting in four years of military service, he earned his living as a shoe salesman, a soda jerk, a truck driver, a janitor and a doorman while trying to make a name for himself in New York and California.\n\nHe was constantly underestimated. As a 26-year-old would-be professional, he was drummed out of the Pasadena Playhouse for having \"no talent,\" he said. A decade later, he was fired from the cast of \"The Graduate\" during rehearsals.\n\nHe stoked his resentment against those who had slighted him and used it as fuel. Francis Ford Coppola said Hackman seemed utterly miserable during the filming of the 1974 surveillance thriller \"The Conversation.\" Well, he had his reasons for his low mood on set. \"The misery was partially Coppola's fault,\" he explained in an interview with The New York Times, \"because he had let it be known that he wanted [Marlon] Brando for that role, and Brando didn't want to do it. I loved the idea of the role, but I also knew that I was second choice.\"\n\nMost actors are flattered when an acclaimed auteur writes them a part. But Hackman was flat-out irritated when Wes Anderson told him he was writing a character -- the mercurial patriarch Royal Tenenbaum -- specifically for him. \"He said, 'I don't like it when people write for me, because you don't know me, and I don't want what you think is me,'\" Anderson recalled.\n\nDuring the making of \"The Royal Tenenbaums,\" Hackman gave Anderson hell and alienated his fellow cast members. Ten years later, during an anniversary screening of the movie at the New York Film Festival, his co-stars Anjelica Huston and Bill Murray publicly called him out for his behavior.\n\nHackman had simply not bothered to tell anyone that his obstreperousness was part of his grouchy, old-school process. \"There was great love on the set,\" he said in an interview shortly after the film was released. \"Yet at the same time I was very conflicted, because people were much younger than me and I felt left out or ignored. And that wasn't even true. I knew it wasn't true, but I used it anyway.\"\n\nAs a child of the Depression in Danville, Illinois, he dreamed of becoming an actor. But when he compared himself to the square-jawed swashbucklers on the silver screen, he felt unworthy of his ambition, even ashamed of himself for entertaining the notion that he could be a star.\n\n\"I would come out of the theater having seen an Errol Flynn movie and look in the mirror in the lobby of the theater and be stunned that I didn't look like that guy,\" he said in a 1986 interview. \"I desperately wanted to do it, but I never really thought I could until much later.\"\n\nIt turned out that Hackman possessed something better than mere handsomeness. It was a stubborn life force that couldn't help but come through whenever he was on camera. It made him more memorable than any matinee idol.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.", "summary": "(Appraisal)", "url": "https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/gene-hackmans-gritty-grouchy-old-school-style/article_f855846d-6b76-530f-99ae-14f68e4ddf10.html", "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:13:13", "author": "Blox Content Management,Jim Windolf", "authors": ["Blox Content Management", "Jim Windolf"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.235}, {"id": 295549134, "title": "Pus-Filled Injections and Green Witches: Movie Makeup Got Real", "text": "Actors may deliver impassioned speeches about achieving their \"childhood dreams,\" but we don't often hear about how those sculpting wounds with clay and bubbling skin with latex are fulfilling their lifelong fantasies.\n\n\"Teenager treats\" is how Pierre Olivier Persin, the special effects designer nominated for an Oscar for makeup and hairstyling for \"The Substance,\" described his work on the film, which involved two full-body prosthetics and countless other pieces and puppets. Mike Marino, the makeup designer for Sebastian Stan in \"A Different Man,\" nominated in the same category, described his childhood bedroom as a sort of cabinet of curiosities, filled with \"jars of experiments and screaming Siamese twins.\"\n\nIt's a particularly exciting year for makeup and hairstyling nominees: buckets of blood and pus-filled injections in \"The Substance\"; face tumors sloughing off like jelly in \"A Different Man\"; green witches and blue horses in \"Wicked\"; a vampire shriveling away in \"Nosferatu\"; and a menacing drug lord created with facial prosthetics in \"Emilia P\u00e9rez.\"\n\nWhile in years past the category has sometimes leaned toward honoring the subtle transformations of delicately coifed period hairstyles, these nominees reflect a year that relied heavily on the use of makeup to create practical special effects.\n\nOnce upon a time, most special effects were achieved with makeup. Think \"An American Werewolf in London\" (1981), \"The Fly\" (1986), \"Beetlejuice\" (1988): All the various monsters, mutations and marvels in these films were largely created with latex, foam and human hands. Then, in the early 2000s, studios became more reliant on computers to digitally generate these effects.\n\n\"When the new kid on the block shows up, everybody wants to go play with them,\" said Ve Neill, who won makeup and hairstyling Oscars for \"Beetlejuice,\" \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" (1993) and \"Ed Wood\" (1994), on the early CGI frenzy. But she said she knew even then that makeup artists weren't replaceable by computers. \"I was never terribly worried about it,\" she said.\n\nIf this year's Oscar nominations are any indication, her instincts were correct: Practical makeup effects might be headed for a resurgence.\n\nCynthia Erivo, who played the green-skinned witch Elphaba in \"Wicked,\" has been vocal about her preference to be physically painted rather than having the hue added in postproduction. \"She wanted to see her hands. She wanted to get that reaction\" from the other cast members, said Frances Hannon, the hair and makeup designer for the film.\n\nMarino said that Stan, who wore prosthetics in \"A Different Man\" to resemble someone with facial tumors, personally reached out to him after hearing about his work from colleagues. Marino designed the prosthetic-heavy makeup for the HBO series \"The Penguin.\" Colin Farrell, who wore the complex look, praised Marino's work after winning this year's Golden Globe for best actor in a limited series.\n\nDavid White, the prosthetic makeup effects designer for \"Nosferatu,\" pointed to another benefit of tackling effects practically: a stronger camaraderie among the crew. He spoke with a genuine tenderness about collaborative sets, \"those kind of big spaces where we just throw things around and it's very textural and real.\"\n\nIn creating Count Orlok's look, more than 50 prosthetics, applied on \"everything but the soles of the feet\" (including, somewhat infamously, a prosthetic penis) were used. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, who played the count, was painted in near-total darkness, save for a spotlight to mimic the lighting of the film.\n\n\"I think the organic nature of the whole thing is just so much more tantalizing to the audience,\" Neill said. When you make something with your hands, Marino said, \"some soul carries through.\"\n\nPersin used the metaphor of a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat. \"This is magic,\" he declared, grabbing a metal bowl from his countertop to pantomime. But if the magician procures a rabbit only digitally, \"the magic is gone.\" Though, he clarified, \"I'm not saying that digital things aren't magical\" in their own way.\n\nIt often becomes a question, then, of the particular kind of movie magic to use. For \"Wicked,\" Hannon described a process of trying things both practically and digitally. They did this both for Elphaba's green skin and for a far-less-discussed makeup challenge -- Fiyero's blue horse.\n\nBoth were accomplished practically. The horse, itself a reference to the \"horse of a different color\" from the 1939 \"Wizard of Oz\" film (in the original movie, the animals were sprayed with different flavors of powdered gelatin), was played by three different horses, all of whom were dyed black and then sprayed daily with an iridescent blue paint. Jon M. Chu, the director of \"Wicked,\" expressed his preference for in-camera effects, saying: \"The real, physical things give me inspiration.\"\n\nWhen asked if they felt there was a renewed interest in accomplishing effects practically, some artists were optimistic, though others cited the looming threat of artificial intelligence further digitizing the moviemaking process.\n\n\"We still work a lot,\" Persin said. \"Until when? I don't know.\" He joked about a near future where movies would need the label \"made by humans.\"\n\n\"There's design areas where, no matter what you do, you couldn't transfer them to postproduction,\" Hannon said.\n\nMany artists also spoke to the ways that digital and practical effects could be used in tandem. As an example, the standard practice for a base model of an actor wearing makeup is to create a life cast, a mold made by applying a thick liquid to an actor's body, which cures and can then be used to create a replica.\n\nAlthough life casts are still used, makeup artists now have the option of using 3D scans, a quicker and cleaner option. Digital effects can also be used to smooth out the edges of prosthetic pieces, or to provide transitions between makeup looks. \"It's like a brush,\" Traci Loader, the makeup designer for \"Nosferatu,\" said of digital tools.\n\nMarino was fervent when talking about a possible renewed interest in practical effects. They are society's rebellion against digitization, he said, a way of declaring, \"We're not going to die. You're not going to kill us. We're going to fight through art.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.", "summary": "Actors may deliver impassioned speeches about achieving their \"childhood dreams,\" but we don't often hear about how those sculpting wounds with clay and bubbling skin with latex are fulfilling their lifelong fantasies.", "url": "https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/pus-filled-injections-and-green-witches-movie-makeup-got-real/article_ee90970c-5391-5c73-9a81-e6950fff6816.html", "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:34:41", "author": "Blox Content Management,Kellina Moore", "authors": ["Blox Content Management", "Kellina Moore"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.122}, {"id": 295540552, "title": "Zelensky inundated with messages of support from world leaders after Trump berates him in Oval Office meeting", "text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s social media site was flooded with moving messages of support from leaders around the world, including the U.S., after he was mocked and yelled at by President Donald Trump Friday in a meeting in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump, the draft dodger who got out of the Vietnam War with a reportedly faked bone spurs excuse, taunted the war president\u2019s black sweater and pants (similar to Elon Musk\u2019s Oval Office attire), and informed Zelensky that his country was in \u201cbig trouble\u201d before the sit down devolved into a shouting match and was ended.\n\nTrump said later on Truth Social that Zelensky had \u201cdisrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office\u201d\n\nFormer Republican Wyoming Rep.

De Villepin, the then French foreign minister, in effect signalled France\u2019s intention to veto a UN resolution authorising the war, forcing the US and UK to act unilaterally. He warned that Washington\u2019s strategy would lead to chaos in the Middle East and undermine international institutions. The prophetic plea was met with applause, a rare event in the security council chamber. It led to the career diplomat\u2019s inclusion as a character in David Hare\u2019s 2004 anti-war play, Stuff Happens.\n\nNow the veteran statesman, who warned about the risks of Europe\u2019s over-reliance on the US many years before it became a mainstream opinion in Paris or Berlin, is back with advice on how to respond to the most serious breakdown in Europe\u2019s relationship with the US in 80 years.\n\nAs Donald Trump alienates America\u2019s oldest allies at alarming speed, European leaders are scrambling to adjust to the new, chaotic world order. But De Villepin believes there is also an opportunity for Europe to unite behind liberal democracy and fill the vacuum left behind by the Trump administration. He is convinced that there is an urgent need for European independence in defence, national security and technology.\n\nIt is a reflection of the alarm in Europe that Paris, for the last month, has been bustling with visiting diplomats, premiers and heads of state. On Monday Emmanuel Macron became the first European leader to be welcomed to the White House since Trump\u2019s return to power. But Macron has also convened world leaders to discuss potential new coalitions of countries willing to step in to blunt the consequences of Trump\u2019s realignment on Ukraine and his apparent readiness to abandon liberal democracy.\n\nTrump\u2019s foreign policy is unpredictable, but he appears now to side with Russia over Ukraine. Even as Macron was at the White House attempting to salvage transatlantic ties, the US voted with Russia against a UN resolution condemning Vladimir Putin\u2019s war. North Korea and Belarus were among only a handful of other nations that followed the US.\n\n\u201cWe now have three illiberal superpowers: Russia, China and the US,\u201d De Villepin says. \u201cAmerica can no longer be considered an ally of Europe.\u201d But he warns that the US will not prosper in this disordered, survival-of-the-fittest world it is creating, \u201cbecause they will be completely isolated\u201d.\n\nHe sees Trump\u2019s authoritarian turn as both a crisis and an opportunity for Europe to unite behind a new common purpose. \u201cThe consequence of this will be a European awakening of democracy. We\u2019re going to fight for liberal democracy more than ever. Because the question now is really: sovereignty or submission.\u201d\n\nAchieving European sovereignty sounds logical, but how do we get there? De Villepin suggests a three-point plan for a more assertive and independent continent. The first step is to develop a common defence pact in Europe, with a significant boost to the European defence industry. \u201cWe urgently need to develop our own systems, and not just buy from the US.\u201d The second is to increase investment in innovation and tech, as outlined in the Draghi report last year, which warned of an \u201cagonising decline\u201d for Europe in the absence of an \u20ac800bn annual spending boost. The third step is to strengthen Franco-British collaboration on defence, intelligence, nuclear issues and Ukraine, where De Villepin wants to see clear security guarantees in the event of a treaty and ceasefire.\n\n\u201cWe have to take our destiny in our own hands,\u201d he says. \u201cStop believing in illusions. Trump is abandoning Ukraine and [Elon] Musk is supporting extremist movements in Europe because they want a weaker EU. They understand that Europe is now the main obstacle for their vision. And this is, of course, not acceptable.\u201d\n\nDoes he support Ukraine\u2019s European \u2013 including French \u2013 allies putting boots on the ground to protect against a future Russian attack? \u201cAs part of an agreed peacekeeping plan by the international community, I would support a French contribution.\u201d\n\nBack in 2003, De Villepin\u2019s impassioned UN speech was delivered during a similar low point in transatlantic relations, with American neoconservatives renaming French fries \u201cfreedom fries\u201d while rightwing news organisations labelled France and other European countries opposing the Iraq invasion an \u201caxis of weasels\u201d.\n\nHis challenge to George Bush\u2019s US, which drew on the painful wartime history underpinning the transatlantic alliance, remains acutely relevant in 2025. \u201cThis message comes to you today from an old country, France, from an old continent like mine, Europe, that has known wars, occupation and barbarity,\u201d he told the security council in 2003. \u201cA country that does not forget and knows everything it owes to the freedom fighters who came from America and elsewhere. And yet has never ceased to stand upright in the face of history and before mankind. Faithful to its values, it wishes resolutely to act with all the members of the international community.\u201d\n\nRumours of a De Villepin run for the \u00c9lys\u00e9e in 2027 have been circulating in the French media. He remains coy about a presidential ambition. What is clear, however, is that he thinks the next wave of national elections across Europe will be decided as much by national security and foreign affairs as by domestic issues. \u201cNational security will be the most important issue for voters, because it\u2019s about liberty, values, whether we believe in sovereignty or submission.\u201d\n\nThis seems to be the rationale behind his return to public life \u2013 not just as a potential presidential candidate in France, but as the unofficial spokesperson for what he calls \u201cEuropean sovereignty\u201d. He used the phrase six times during our 90-minute conversation. \u201cWith my background, my opposition to the Iraq war and all my experience of dealing with geopolitical crises, I felt that there were missing voices speaking up for the defence of Europe, the defence of our values, so it was my duty to speak up.\u201d\n\nDe Villepin belongs to a long tradition of French politicians sceptical of America\u2019s global supremacy, and now feels vindicated. But he\u2019s not pushing a dogmatic anti-Americanism. He has close ties to the US, studied there, and emphasises his respect for America\u2019s soft power, its universities, its culture of innovation. \u201cThey are giving that up for this absurd idea of full power. They are ignoring history. You can never win with fire alone.\u201d\n\nHe forecasts that mass protests against Trump will emerge across the US as soon as the failures of his policies become evident. He predicts, like most economists, that the trade tariffs will lead to exploding inflation and layoffs, and that Trump\u2019s \u201creckless\u201d foreign policy will make the country much weaker. \u201cThis is always the problem for the nationalists and populists. What I call the principle of reality.\u201d\n\nThe problem, I suggest, is that the far right is waging war on reality, and it seems to be winning \u2013 at least in the US. In the presidential election last year, Trump won the popular vote with a small margin of 1.5 percentage points nationwide, but he won by an average of 54 points in \u201cnews deserts\u201d, where few serious local media outlets are available, according to a study from Northwestern University.\n\nDe Villepin sees this as an urgent call to build up the European tech industry and encourage independence from US platforms. \u201cElon Musk wants a complete vassalisation of Europe and European media. So this is a question of our fundamental liberties, and our freedom to think what we want to think. We need to build our own tools, whether it\u2019s LLMs [large language models], social platforms or cloud tech. We have to understand that this is a state of emergency.\u201d\n\nBefore Germany\u2019s general election on 23 February, Musk campaigned frenetically for the far right AfD, but to less effect than he might have hoped for. The party was polling at about 20% when Musk embraced it and ended up with 20.8% of the vote. De Villepin does not believe that a Musk intervention in favour of the far right would be particularly successful in France, either. \u201cOh, it would be the surest way for Le Pen to lose, if Elon Musk came here to campaign with her.\u201d\n\nJordan Bardella, the youthful president of Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally party, cancelled a trip to a rightwing conference in the US after the former Trump aide Steve Bannon made what appeared to be a Nazi salute at the event.\n\nDe Villepin predicts that Le Pen will try to keep some distance between herself and Trump\u2019s Maga movement, but he insists they are ideological twins. \u201cShe\u2019s very close to Russia. Close to these ideas. Anti-globalisation, anti-immigration, anti-multiculturalism. So they\u2019re completely linked.\u201d\n\nHis own path to a potential presidential candidacy might be filled with obstacles and contradictions. As a pro-Palestinian, moderate conservative Gaullist, he could struggle to get past the first round. But he clearly sees a political future where his foreign policy experience will top most immediate domestic concerns.\n\nFor now, he says, European nationalists can gather, as they did recently in Madrid, laud Trump and pledge to \u201cmake Europe great again\u201d \u2013 but soon, he believes, Trump will be a toxic brand in Europe. \u201cThis is an opportunity for Europe to be the voice of stability,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause here, we know the consequences of authoritarian nationalism.\u201d\n\n Martin Gelin writes for the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter", "summary": "The former French PM says the US is no longer an ally of Europe \u2013 but has joined Russia and China as an \u2018illiberal superpower\u2019\n\nDominique de Villepin made his name with a memorable speech to the UN security council in February 2003, just before the US-led invasion of Iraq. De Villepin, the then French foreign minister, in effect signalled France\u2019s intention to veto a UN resolution authorising the war, forcing the US and UK to act unilaterally. He warned that Washington\u2019s strategy would lead to chaos in the Middle East and undermine international institutions. The prophetic plea was met with applause, a rare event in the security council chamber. It led to the career diplomat\u2019s inclusion as a character in David Hare\u2019s 2004 anti-war play, Stuff Happens.\n\nNow the veteran statesman, who warned about the risks of Europe\u2019s over-reliance on the US many years before it became a mainstream opinion in Paris or Berlin, is back with advice on how to respond to the most serious breakdown in Europe\u2019s relationship with the ", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/01/trump-is-abandoning-ukraine-and-wants-a-weaker-eu-dominique-de-villepin-on-europes-moment-of-truth", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b129a39f8ab7207041ba93346bd1f842d319c66f/558_119_3610_2166/master/3610.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZ", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:00:34", "author": "Martin Gelin", "authors": ["Martin Gelin"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.153}, {"id": 295540510, "title": "Fact Check: Is magnesium deficiency the number one cause of high blood pressure?", "text": "An Instagram post claims that magnesium deficiency is the number one cause of high blood pressure. The claim by the user is MisleadingClaimIn an Instagram reel, it is claimed that magnesium deficiency is the number one cause of high blood pressure. In the reel by user swetha._.sunil, it is said, \"The single most common cause of high blood pressure is a deficiency in the mineral magnesium. You have two types of blood vessels in the human body. You have arteries and you have veins. And arteries carry blood away from the heart, veins carry blood back to the heart. Well, what's the difference? Well, there's one significant difference between the two. Arteries have muscles, veins do not. Why does an artery have muscle? Because God is smart. When the heart pumps blood, it goes into the artery and the muscle in the artery constricts and relaxes. constricts and relaxes constriction relaxes in order to help the heart pump the blood. That's fantastic. Well, how does the muscle constrict and relax? The same way that a bicep constrict and relax or any muscle in the body, it's done through magnesium and calcium. If you do not have enough magnesium, the muscle will constrict, but it cannot relax. So it stays constricted. Now, if you have a garden hose and there's water coming out of it and you squeeze the hose just a little bit, the water comes out faster, right? It's because you've decreased the volume, the pressure goes up. So when the artery gets collapsed because of not enough magnesium, the blood pressure spikes. So, you don't have high blood pressure because you have a circulatory system. You don't have high blood pressure because you have a bad gene. You don't have high blood pressure because you're getting older or because you have a voodoo curse. You have high blood pressure because your body ran out of the stuff it needed to maintain proper blood pressure. Period.\"The reel can be accessed here.Fact CheckThe claim by the user is Misleading. While magnesium deficiency contributes to high blood pressure, no scientific evidence or medical consensus supports the claim that it is the number one cause of blood pressure.What is High Blood Pressure?According to WHO, High blood pressure or Hypertension is when the pressure in blood vessels is high (140/90 mmHg or higher). It is common but can be serious if not treated. The risk factors of hypertension are genetics, overweight or obese, physical inactivity, age and consumption of alcohol.Modifiable risk factors include unhealthy diets such as excessive salt consumption, a diet high in saturated fat and trans fats, low intake of fruits and vegetables, physical inactivity, consumption of tobacco and alcohol, and being overweight or obese. In addition, there are environmental risk factors for hypertension and associated diseases, where air pollution is the most significant.Non-modifiable risk factors include a family history of hypertension, age over 65 years and co-existing diseases such as diabetes or kidney disease.What are the causes of High Blood Pressure?High blood pressure (hypertension) is a multifactorial condition influenced by both genetic and lifestyle factors. Several risk factors contribute to its development. Primary hypertension, the most common type, is linked to aging, family history, race (with African Americans being at higher risk), and lifestyle choices such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, high salt intake, lack of physical activity, and obesity. Secondary hypertension, on the other hand, results from underlying conditions like chronic kidney disease, hormonal imbalances (e.g., thyroid disorders, Cushing\u2019s syndrome), obstructive sleep apnea, and certain medications such as NSAIDs and decongestants. Managing hypertension requires early detection, lifestyle modifications, and, in some cases, medical intervention to prevent serious complications like heart disease and stroke.What is Magnesium?Magnesium is an essential mineral in the body that functions as a cofactor in over 300 enzyme systems regulating biochemical processes such as protein synthesis, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, and blood pressure regulation. It is crucial for energy production, DNA/RNA synthesis, and bone structure. Magnesium also facilitates calcium and potassium transport across cell membranes, influencing nerve impulses, muscle contraction, and heart rhythm. About 50\u201360% of magnesium is stored in bones, with less than 1% in blood serum, where levels are tightly regulated by the kidneys.What is the role of Magnesium in maintaining blood pressure? Magnesium plays a crucial role in maintaining blood pressure by acting as a natural calcium channel blocker, which helps relax blood vessels and reduce vascular resistance. It also blocks sodium attachment to vascular smooth muscle cells, preventing excessive contraction. Additionally, magnesium enhances vasodilating prostaglandin E (PGE) production, binds potassium cooperatively, and increases nitric oxide...", "url": "https://medicaldialogues.in/fact-check/fact-check-is-magnesium-deficiency-the-number-one-cause-of-high-blood-pressure-144029", "image": "https://medicaldialogues.in/h-upload/2025/02/26/276168-knee-pain.webp", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 05:30:00", "author": "Dr Arvind Chopra,Nidhi Srivastava", "authors": ["Dr Arvind Chopra", "Nidhi Srivastava"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.07}, {"id": 295540512, "title": "Finerenone May Help Prevent Worsening Heart Failure, suggests JAMA study", "text": "A new study published in JAMA Cardiology identified that outpatient worsening heart failure (HF) events necessitating oral diuretic escalation are frequent and associated with a poor prognosis. Finerenone shows potential in preventing outpatient worsening heart failure in patients with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction. This study was conducted by Jonathan W. and colleagues.A recent secondary analysis of the FINEARTS-HF trial assessed the impact of finerenone, a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction (HFmrEF/HFpEF). The trial assessed whether finerenone could decrease the necessity for outpatient oral diuretic escalation and its effect on clinical outcomes.Patients with heart failure and an ejection fraction of 40% or more were enrolled in this worldwide, multicenter, double-blind randomized controlled trial. The trial compared finerenone versus a placebo effect on outpatient worsening HF events that necessitated the use of loop or thiazide diuretics. As worsening HF episodes, such as hospitalizations and urgent visits, are related to increased mortality risk, the recognition of effective treatment to control worsening HF episodes will be vital for enhancing patient outcomes.The secondary analysis was based on the FINEARTS-HF trial data with 6,001 participants at a mean age of 72.0 years, 46% of whom were female (2,732 patients). The participants were allocated randomly to either finerenone or placebo in a 1:1 fashion.Worsening HF events were defined as:\u2022 HF hospitalizations (664 events)\u2022 Urgent HF visits with intravenous diuretic treatment (87 events)\u2022 Outpatient oral diuretic uptitration (1,250 events)Primary outcome events, such as cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization, and urgent HF visits, were centrally adjudicated. Investigators measured the risk of mortality after each category of worsening HF event and assessed the effect of finerenone on outpatient intensification of oral diuretics alone and as included in an extended composite outcome of cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization, and urgent HF visits.Key Findings\u2022 HF hospitalization: 27.7 deaths per 100 patient-years (95% CI, 24.3-31.5)\u2022 Urgent HF visits: 13.6 deaths per 100 patient-years (95% CI, 8.8-21.1)\u2022 Outpatient oral diuretic intensification: 11.6 deaths per 100 patient-years (95% CI, 10.2-13.1)\u2022 Patients without worsening HF: 4.5 deaths per 100 patient-years (95% CI, 4.2-4.9)\u2022 Outpatient oral diuretic intensification considerably augmented the rate of patients having HF-related events from 1,343 to 2,238 cases.\u2022 Finerenone lowered the hazard of outpatient oral diuretic intensification\u2022 Hazard ratio (HR), 0.89 (95% CI, 0.80-0.98; p=0.02)\u2022 Finerenone also decreased the risk in a longer composite outcome (CV death, HF hospitalization, urgent HF visit, and outpatient oral diuretic intensification); HR, 0.85 (95% CI, 0.78-0.92; p<0.001)The research proved that finerenone minimized outpatient worsening HF events necessitating oral diuretic escalation in HFmrEF and HFpEF patients with increased risk of mortality. These findings highlight the importance of having finerenone as part of the treatment strategy for preserved ejection fraction heart failure patients, especially in minimizing outpatient worsening HF events.Reference:Cunningham JW, Chatur S, Claggett BL, et al.

Recent findings suggest its potential as an off-label add-on treatment, showing positive outcomes for patients suffering from hidradenitis suppurativa.A recent study found that the off-label use of botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) can be an effective add-on treatment for symptom control in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). Led by Noor F. Goandal from Zealand University Hospital, the study highlights the continued need for alternative therapies despite the availability of biologics like secukinumab, adalimumab, and bimekizumab. BoNT-A, known for treating hyperhidrosis, may also reduce inflammation by inhibiting mast cell degranulation, a key factor in HS severity. The retrospective case series analyzed eight HS patients treated with BoNT-A between 2018 and 2023. Investigators assessed treatment efficacy using numeric rating scales (NRS) and a Likert scale to evaluate suppuration, pain relief, and effects on daily activities. Participants reported high satisfaction with a median NRS score of 8.5. A moderate reduction was noted among six patients with suppuration (median NRS 6.5). Pain relief was also moderate (median score 2.5), while improvements in work/education were minimal (median score 0.5). Physical activity showed some enhancement (median score 1.5). All participants said they would recommend the treatment. The study's pain reduction findings align with prior research on BoNT-A and a randomised trial of botulinum toxin type B for hidradenitis suppurativa. Compared to tetracycline, which significantly lowered pain scores from 6 to 4, and adalimumab, which reduced pain by 30%, BoNT-A showed moderate but promising results. Researchers attribute these benefits to its inhibition of neurogenic inflammation and mast cell degranulation, potentially reducing abscess formation. The authors emphasize the need for a randomized, placebo-controlled study to further evaluate BoNT-A\u2019s effects on pain, suppuration, quality of life, and disease severity. Their findings lay the groundwork for future research on BoNT-A as a potential hidradenitis suppurativa treatment.Reference:Goandal, N.F., Jemec, G.B.E. and Saunte, D.M.L.

This positive change has been brought to the industry because President Tinubu understands what it means to run a business.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the NCAA has disclosed that in one year, it approved five Air Operating Certificates (AOCs) for five applicants, noting that such performance was never achieved in the past.An AOC is a certificate that allows an operator to perform specific operations of commercial air transport service, which include charter services, cargo freighting or scheduled passenger service.\n\nThe Director General of NCAA said that with the approval of AOC by NCAA, it implies that five prospective airlines have been approved to commence commercial flight operations as soon as possible.\n\nNajomo said during the process of approving the AOCs, he ensured the applicants did not cut corners and all safety demands were met and noted that all the prospective airlines went through all procedures and completed them.\n\nSpeaking on aging aircraft in Nigeria, he said it is not how new an aircraft is that makes it safe but how well the aircraft is maintained.\n\n\u201cThe NCAA is carrying out surveillance on all aircraft operating in Nigeria to ensure these aircraft are maintained. Brand new aircraft still take-off and crash. So, the age of an aircraft doesn\u2019t determine how safe it is,\u201d he explained.\n\nSpeaking on scarcity of jobs in the aviation sector, Najomo said the NCAA is doing its best to ensure airlines bring in more aircraft, adding that the presence of more aircraft would mean more jobs for pilots, flight dispatchers, engineers amongst others.\n\nConcerning Air France, Keyamo in his X handle @fkeyamo, hinted, \u201cI have just been alerted of a situation involving mostly Nigerian passengers left stranded at Lome, Togo, by @airfrance.\n\n\u201cI am told that the flight from Paris bound for Abuja could not land due to the bad weather in Abuja this evening.\n\n\u201cThe flight then diverted to Lome. However, the confounding situation now is that instead of bringing the passengers back to Abuja after the storm subsided, there are plans to leave them in Lome till tomorrow, even when that same flight will return to Abuja tonight to pick passengers.\n\n\u201cAfter directing my Director of Air Transport management to call the country Manager of @airfrance, I also personally called @AirFranceNG a few minutes ago and insisted that those passengers must be brought back to Abuja tonight or be treated in line with best international standards if they must sleep in Lome,\u201d the Aviation Minister said.", "summary": "*\u00a0Directs Air France to return Nigerian passengers to Abuja\u00a0 Chinedu Eze in Lagos and Kasim Sumaina in Abuja The Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, Festus Keyamo, has said that", "url": "https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2025/03/01/keyamo-threatens-not-to-approve-foreign-airlines-summer-schedule/", "image": "https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/Festus-Keyamo-3.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 02:38:21", "author": "Ayo Yusuf", "authors": ["Ayo Yusuf"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ng", "sentiment": -0.191}, {"id": 295540468, "title": "Expert Warns Tax Reform Bills May Undermine Customs Operations, Revenue Drive", "text": "James Emejo in Abuja\n\nA renowned tax and customs expert, Okey Ibeke, has cautioned that the proposed tax reform bills before the National Assembly have the potential to undermine the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) specialised operations, which remained crucial for the country\u2019s revenue drive.\n\nHe stressed that the NCS\u2019 duties which are highly technical and extend far beyond revenue collection could be eroded unless relevant concerns relating to the bills are addressed.Ibeke\u2019s remarks came against the backdrop of a recent public hearing on tax reform bills organised by the House of Representatives Special Committee on Tax Reform Bills.\n\nHe warned that passing the bills without necessary adjustments could render the NCS redundant, a situation that could negatively impact revenue collection for development projects.He said although the Comptroller-General of the Customs, Mr. Adewale Adeniyi, had said the tax reform aligned with President Bola Tinubu\u2019s commitment to an efficient tax system, certain aspects of the bills could hamper the service\u2019s ability to perform its core functions.\n\nIbeke, specifically expressed concerns that designated revenue agencies may lack the technical expertise, specialised workforce, and continuous training required to handle customs\u2019 operations.He noted that these agencies might struggle to detect undervalued or misclassified goods, potentially leading to the acceptance of inaccurate importer declarations.\n\n\u201cCustoms work is more than just collecting revenue. It involves classifying cargo, understanding tariff classifications, and conducting customs valuations. Without the expertise to classify cargo and determine the applicable duty rates, there will be significant challenges. Only well-trained customs personnel can effectively perform these functions,\u201d Ibeke said.\n\nHe stressed the importance of applying Rules of Origin (RoO), which are essential for determining the national source of products, as well as critical for assessing the value of imports, calculating appropriate revenue, and identifying fraudulent practices \u2013 tasks that general tax administration systems are ill-equipped to handle.\n\nAccording to him, the NCS has already made significant strides in modernising its operations through its Trade Modernisation Project (TMP), stressing that the deployment of the \u2018B Odogwu\u2019 software, for instance, had contributed to increased revenue collection and positioned the service to surpass its 2025 revenue target.\n\nIbeke therefore prevailed on the federal government to increase funding for the service to address revenue collection challenges rather than repealing the 2023 NCS Act, which took over eight years to pass into law.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe NCS has established infrastructure and is leveraging technology to facilitate trade. Repealing the Act would undermine these efforts and hinder progress.\n\n\u201cIs the federal government planning to dismantle the customs service? Will they employ customs officers to work in the new agency? Will they create offices for them within the agency? This could lead to confusion. Ultimately, the government, which aims to maximise revenue, stands to lose the most,\u201d he said.\n\nIbeke argued that if the NCS was no longer responsible for revenue collection, it could result in reduced import duty collections.\n\nHe said, \u201cCustoms officers may simply approve whatever declarations importers submit, leading to significant revenue losses.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Adeniyi, during the public hearing, urged the committee to uphold the NCS\u2019 mandate under the 2023 Act, emphasising the importance of ensuring that the final bills do not contradict the Act, thereby preserving the agency\u2019s core functions and operational efficiency.\n\nStakeholders also called for a balanced approach that strengthens the country\u2019s tax system without compromising the critical functions of the service.\n\nThe bills under consideration include the Nigeria Tax Bill, Nigeria Tax Administration Bill, Nigeria Revenue Service Establishment Bill, and Joint Revenue Board Establishment Bill.", "summary": "James Emejo in Abuja A renowned tax and customs expert, Okey Ibeke, has \u00a0cautioned that the proposed tax reform bills before the National Assembly have the potential to undermine the", "url": "https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2025/03/01/expert-warns-tax-reform-bills-may-undermine-customs-operations-revenue-drive/", "image": "https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/Ttax-Reform.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 02:40:33", "author": "Ayo Yusuf", "authors": ["Ayo Yusuf"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "ng", "sentiment": 0.119}, {"id": 295540464, "title": "As Pope Francis Recovers, Cardinal De Donatis to Preside Ash Wednesday Liturgy", "text": "The Holy See Press Office yesterday announced that Cardinal Angelo De Donatis, Major Penitentiary of Apostolic Penitentiary, will preside at the traditional celebration of the Ash Wednesday liturgy on the Aventine Hill, which will take place next week Wednesday.\n\nMaintaining an ancient Roman tradition revived by St. John XXIII, the Pope usually begins the Ash Wednesday \u201cstational\u201d liturgy at the church of Sant\u2019Anselmo before leading a penitential procession to the Basilica of Santa Sabina on the Aventine Hill, where he celebrates Mass.\n\nAccording to Vatican News, since Pope Francis is in Rome\u2019s Gemelli Hospital to receive treatment for bilateral pneumonia, he has delegated the Cardinal to preside in his place for this year\u2019s ceremony.According to a message from Archbishop Giovanni Diego Ravelli, the Master of Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations, the Ash Wednesday celebration begins with the \u2018stational liturgy\u2019 at 4:30 PM in Sant\u2019Anselmo, followed by the procession to Santa Sabina.\n\nThe procession will include Cardinals, Archbishops, Bishops, the Benedictine Monks of Sant\u2019Anselmo, the Dominican Fathers of Santa Sabina, and some of the faithful.At the end of the procession, in the Basilica of Santa Sabina, the Eucharistic Celebration will take place, including the rite of blessing and the imposition of ashes.\n\n\u201cThe Cardinals, Archbishops, Bishops, Benedictine Monks, and Dominican Fathers who wish to participate in the celebration, Archbishop Ravelli said, are requested to be at the Church of Sant\u2019Anselmo by 4 PM, wearing their proper choir attire,\u201d the statement added.", "summary": "The Holy See Press Office yesterday announced that Cardinal Angelo De Donatis, Major Penitentiary of Apostolic Penitentiary, will preside at the traditional celebration of the Ash Wednesday liturgy on the", "url": "https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2025/03/01/as-pope-francis-recovers-cardinal-de-donatis-to-preside-ash-wednesday-liturgy/", "image": "https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/Cardinal-De-Donatis.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 02:39:40", "author": "Ayo Yusuf", "authors": ["Ayo Yusuf"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ng", "sentiment": 0.409}, {"id": 295540466, "title": "Slain Lawmaker: Onitsha Indigenes Ask IG to take over Investigation, Cite Lack of Trust in Anambra Command", "text": "David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka\n\nThe Onitsha community has risen over the recent murder of their son, member representing Onitsha North 1 State Constituency, Hon.

confirming that the first day of the holy month will be on Sunday (March 2).\n\nThe 24-member commi-ttee, chaired by Maulana Abdul Khabir Azad, convened in Peshawar at the Administrator Auqaf office on Charsadda Road.\n\n\u201cNo report of moon sighting has been received from any part of the country. Therefore, the first day of Ramazan will be on Sunday,\u201d announced Maulana Azad after the meeting. He noted that cloudy weather prevailed in most parts of the country, although some regions experienced clear skies.\n\nZonal Ruet-i-Hilal committees held meetings in Karachi, Lahore, Islam-abad and Quetta, but no credible reports of moon sighting were received from any of these locations. The Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee operates in coordination with local and national agencies to ensure accurate moon sighting.\n\nMaulana Azad said the Ruet Hilal Committee was also assisted by the meteorological office, the Ministry of Religious Affairs, Suparco, the science and technology department and other related officials.\n\nCommittee members who attended the meeting included Maulana Hafiz Abdul Ghafoor, Maulana Yaseen Zafar, Maulana Ashraf Ali, Mufti Qari Mehrullah, Maulana Sardar Muhammad Khan Laghari and Sahibzada Syed Habibullah Chishti, among others.\n\nMeanwhile, an unofficial moon sighting committee at Qasim Ali Khan Mosque in Peshawar, led by Mufti Shahabuddin Popalzai, also convened on Friday. The committee, attended by clerics from adjacent areas, also announced the start of Ramazan on Sunday, in line with the Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cNo witnesses regarding the moon sighting were received, so Ramazan will begin on Sunday (March 2),\u201d Mufti Popalzai announced.\n\nSaudi Arabia, Gulf nations\n\nSaudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbours on Friday announced that Ramazan would begin on Saturday (today), AFP reported. Saudi Arabia was joined by the United Arab Emirates and Qatar in declaring the sighting of the crescent moon that heralds Ramazan.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court has decided that tomorrow, Saturday, is the first day of the month of (Ramazan),\u201d the official Saudi Press Agency posted on X.\n\nSeveral Muslim countries declare Ramazan in line with the announcement in Saudi Arabia. The UAE, Qatar and Oman also said Ramazan would start on Saturday.\n\nIraq\u2019s top Shia cleric, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, meanwhile announced that the holy month would begin on Sunday.\n\nAI-equipped drones\n\nThe United Arab Emirates flew AI-equipped drones to help spot the crescent moon marking the start of Ramazan, official media said on Friday.\n\nThe \u201cworld-first\u201d innovation puts a new twist on a centuries-old tradition where people scan the skies for the first glimpse of the newly visible moon.\n\n\u201cThe use of AI-powered drones extends the concept of direct visual observation, which remains the primary method for confirming the sighting of the crescent moon,\u201d the WAM news agency said, citing the UAE Council for Fatwa.\n\nThe report did not give details about the drones and how they would use artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n\u201cThis method will complement traditional naked-eye sighting accounts and advanced astronomical observatories across the country, which are equipped with state-of-the-art technology to ensure precise moon sighting,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe UAE also gave the green light to moon-spotters to scour the heavens on Friday. Moon sightings can be reported using a hotline number or an online form.\n\nThe country, which appointed the world\u2019s first minister of state for AI in 2017 and launched the Falcon generative AI model in 2023, is vying to be a world leader in the technology.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 1st, 2025", "summary": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1894990#:~:text=begin%20on%20Sunday.-,AI%2Dequipped%20drones,-The%20United%20Arab", "url": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1894990", "image": "https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/03/01100106c0ee242.jpg?r=100109", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 05:01:50", "author": "Dawn Report", "authors": ["Dawn Report"], "language": "en", "source_country": "pk", "sentiment": 0.106}, {"id": 295540310, "title": "China warns of retaliation if US raises tariffs", "text": "BEIJING: Beijing said on Friday it opposed President Donald Trump\u2019s latest threat to slap an extra 10 per cent duty on Chinese imports, accusing the US of \u201cshifting the blame\u201d for the flow of fentanyl and promising retaliation to protect its interests.\n\nChina\u2019s commerce ministry said the country has some of the world\u2019s strictest anti-drug policies and highlighted the risks new tariffs would bring to global supply chains.\n\nTrump said on Thursday his proposed 25 per cent tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods would take effect on Tuesday (Match 4), along with the extra 10 per cent duty on Chinese imports.\n\nThe fresh China tariffs, in addition to the 10 per cent tariff levied on Feb 4, coincide with the start of China\u2019s annual parliamentary meetings on Wednesday, a set-piece political event where Beijing is expected to unveil its main economic priorities for the year.\n\nThe announcement also leaves Beijing less than a week to publish countermeasures, as the Trump administration shows signs of a hardening in its stance towards its strategic rival despite backing down on the threat of tariffs of up to 60 per cent when Trump took office.\n\n\u201cChina has repeatedly stated that unilateral tariffs violate World Trade Organisation rules and undermine the multilateral trading system,\u201d a commerce ministry spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\u201cChina has one of the strictest and most thoroughly enforced anti-drug policies in the world,\u201d it said. \u201c(The US) once again is threatening additional tariffs.

Even though, as a transgender woman, she had had female gender markers on her documents since she was a young teen.\n\n\"It's impossible,\" said Raf Simons, the Prada co-creative director, backstage, of Schafer's situation. \"But it's happening.\"\n\nAnd it's part of the reason the question of femininity -- what it looks like and what might define it now and in the future instead of in the past -- was the question of the season for Simons and Miuccia Prada.\n\nOr rather, as Prada said backstage, \"What kind of femininity can you maintain in this difficult moment?\"\n\nWe are conditioned, Simons added, to think about that issue in a classic way, which generally is also a cliched way: to embrace Ozempic and corsets and restrictions.\n\nBut what if, they asked, you liberated yourself from all that? What if you ran screaming in the opposite direction?\n\nCue a show conceived as a riposte to the whole idea of female stereotype. One that blew a raspberry in the eye of the male gaze and then turned its back for good measure. To a certain extent the exploration of ugliness and the imposition of unattainable female ideals have always been the existential subjects of Prada's career. Just as the tension between what she is trying to say (something political) with the seeming frivolity of her chosen vehicle (luxury fashion) has driven her designs. And her backstage conversations.\n\nRarely, however, has the process looked so imperative. Or so much, frankly, like she and Simons were trolling the Miss Universe establishment and testing the limits of the Prada mystique.\n\nThese are black times? Fine. Enter the little black dress -- only imagine Audrey Hepburn playing the mad woman in Tiffany's attic, storming out to a techno beat, ratting up her hair and letting out her seams. Then the little black dress might be a loose black schmatta, with just the ghost of a bow or some big, fabric-covered buttons. And things might mutate from there.\n\nNothing fit quite right. Not the oversize knits that looked like sweater dresses gone survivalist, or the sofa-print Doris Day housedresses that seemed to have been pulled straight off a love seat, or the leather paper-bag waist skirts so un-body-con they jounced around the rib cage on their own. Instead of lingerie dressing there were scrunched-up pajama separates with the wrinkles baked in; instead of necklaces, jeweled ribbed necklines that appeared to have been severed from well-behaved cardigans; instead of buttons on a big gray overcoat, clusters of pearls, like little iridescent pustules. Their reshaping was more of a de-shaping.\n\nThe result was aggressively, kind of thrillingly, unflattering (well, except for the lush shearling jackets that looked like mink and the slick trousers -- a few pieces have to be commercial). But it was also purposeful. These clothes weren't trying to be charming and glamorous and failing. They were trying to force confrontation. They aimed to please no one except the body inside, freed from any binding, and the woman who inhabits that body.\n\nThey definitely weren't pretty, but they were something even more compelling: They were relevant.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.", "summary": "MILAN -- Celebrities have been thin on the ground in Milan, in part thanks to fashion week's conjunction with the Oscars, but a group came out for Prada, including Gal Gadot, Maya Hawke, Simone Ashley and Hunter Schafer.", "url": "https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/prada-buries-the-corset/article_e2d2543a-519d-5773-a0f6-5168ad58ae9a.html", "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 04:45:46", "author": "Blox Content Management,Vanessa Friedman", "authors": ["Blox Content Management", "Vanessa Friedman"], "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.233}, {"id": 295534832, "title": "Why a Japanese Oscar Contender Isn't Being Shown in Japan", "text": "TOKYO -- A film by a Japanese woman about her search for justice from uncooperative authorities after she reported being raped is a contender at Sunday's Academy Awards. Yet, despite being the first full-length documentary made by a Japanese director ever nominated for an Oscar, the movie cannot be seen in her home country.\n\nIn the film, \"Black Box Diaries,\" journalist Shiori Ito tells the story of what happened to her after she reported being raped at a hotel by a prominent television journalist and the ordeal she says she experienced with Japan's justice system.\n\nThe film, which is up for best documentary feature, premiered in January 2024 at the Sundance Film Festival. It was released in U.S. theaters in October and can currently be seen or is slated to be shown in over 30 countries. However, those do not include Japan.\n\nThe Japanese subsidiary of a major streaming service declined to distribute the film in early 2024, the filmmakers said, and theaters have so far displayed little interest in showing it. The prospects for the film's release grew even murkier in October when Ito's former lawyers and other previous supporters, including fellow journalists, spoke up against her, saying she had used footage without the consent of people in it.\n\nThis is not the first time that Japan has balked at showing unflattering films that were well received in Hollywood. \"The Cove,\" a documentary about a dolphin hunt in the town of Taiji, and \"Unbroken,\" a feature film about cruel treatment of Allied prisoners during World War II, both opened at least a year after their U.S. premieres. \"The Cove,\" which was made by an American director, won the Oscar for best documentary feature in 2010.\n\nIto said that \"Black Box Diaries\" is running into resistance, despite having a Japanese director, because it shines a light on a topic normally kept in the shadows: how the legal system and society, more broadly, look unfavorably on women who come forward to say they were sexually assaulted.\n\n\"This film is not just about sexual violence. It's about power, corruption and systemic problems,\" Ito said. \"I am making many people uncomfortable, that's for sure.\"\n\nIto, 35, has been a polarizing figure since she came forward in 2017 to say that she was raped while unconscious by journalist Noriyuki Yamaguchi after an evening of drinking over dinner. Yamaguchi, who was the biographer of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, denied the charges, and a criminal case was dropped by prosecutors after two months.\n\nIto won a lawsuit against him for damages in a ruling that was upheld by Japan's Supreme Court.\n\nThe case made her a symbol of Japan's still underdeveloped #MeToo movement, while critics have accused her of grandstanding to advance her career.\n\n\"There is a tendency in Japanese society to avoid talking about hot-button issues,\" said Atsushi Funahashi, a film director. \"I believe this film should become a catalyst to ensure that no woman ever has to go through this kind of painful experience again.\"\n\nThe stress of all the attention appeared to take its toll on Ito. On Feb. 20, she canceled a Tokyo news conference at the last minute, citing medical reasons. A limited screening of an edited version of her film was also scrapped.\n\nA group of lawyers, including those who had represented her in the lawsuit, held their own news conference the same day to reiterate their concerns with the film. They said \"Black Box Diaries\" uses video and audio of a taxi driver, a police detective and one of the lawyers without those individuals' permission.\n\nThey also faulted Ito for including footage of herself being dragged out of a taxi by Yamaguchi when they arrived at the hotel. The footage from a security camera was used without the hotel's permission, said the lawyers, who demanded that it and other scenes be deleted or greatly altered.\n\n\"I must now speak out against someone whom I fought alongside for so many years,\" one of the lawyers, Yoko Nishihiro, said. \"How miserable is this.\"\n\nIn a statement released after canceling her news conference, Ito apologized for \"causing harm\" by not obtaining consent and said she is making a modified version of the film \"to ensure that individuals cannot be identified.\"\n\nAt the same time, there are scenes that Ito and the film's producers say they are unwilling to cut. One of these is the security camera footage from the hotel, which Ito said was \"the only visual proof of the sexual assault.\"\n\nEric Nyari, a producer of the film, said they were trying to negotiate a version of the film that could address the criticisms regarding privacy while still exposing what happened.\n\n\"There are certain areas where we are meeting concerns,\" Nyari said, \"but there are certain areas where we believe we're in the right, and we are not going to change.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.", "summary": "TOKYO -- A film by a Japanese woman about her search for justice from uncooperative authorities after she reported being raped is a contender at Sunday's Academy Awards.

It would come to offer protections in the new nation essentially never seen before: the right to ask things of and to criticize the government; to express opinions, popular or not; to assemble peacefully; to practice diverse religious beliefs; and to have a free press that publishes information without fear of censorship or retribution.\n\nThis constitutional provision reflects the framers' intent to establish a society where individuals have the ability to voice their views and participate actively in shaping the nation's governance while holding their leaders accountable. Together, these five guaranteed liberties continue today to make the people of the United States the freest in the world.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and many of his supporters -- from tech leaders like Elon Musk to populist politicians like Vice President JD Vance -- have spent the past several years portraying themselves as free-speech crusaders. Capitalizing on the censorial strains of the left, they regularly lecture about the necessity of letting people say whatever they want, even if it's hateful, asinine or corrosive.\n\nThat form of free-speech absolutism, which aims to defend not just favored speech but also disfavored speech, has a long and welcome role in American society. The problem is that for all their bluster, these supposed free-speech crusaders have proved themselves consistently intolerant when it comes to words, ideas and perspectives they disagree with.\n\nOver the past month Trump and his allies have embarked on an expansive crackdown on free expression and disfavored speakers that should be decried not just as hypocritical but also as un-American and unconstitutional.\n\nIn the distorted view of the Trump administration, protecting free speech requires controlling free speech -- banning words, phrases and ideas that challenge or complicate government-favored speech. Officials in Washington have spent the past month stripping federal websites of any hint of undesirable words and thoughts, disciplining news organizations that refuse to parrot the president's language and threatening to punish those who have voiced criticism of investigations and prosecutions.\n\nThe Orwellian nature of this approach is deliberate and dangerous. This posture is not about protecting free speech. It is about prioritizing far-right ideology -- and at times celebrating lies and hate speech under the guise of preventing the criminalization of language -- while trying to silence independent thought, inconvenient truths and voices of dissent.\n\nWhen Trump announced that he was changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, for example, it seemed to be an essentially harmless bit of nationalistic chest-puffery, paling in comparison with the real damage he intended to do to national security, public health, the civil service and the rule of law. But then he made it clear that compliance was mandatory.\n\nIn February, a reporter for The Associated Press showed up at an Oval Office event and was barred from entering because the news organization continued referring to the Gulf by the internationally recognized name it has had since at least the 16th century. That was an editorial decision that the AP, just like The New York Times and many other outlets, has every right to make on its own without government interference.\n\nThe White House press office then upped the ante; it is now keeping AP reporters and photographers away from many press events and off Air Force One on presidential trips, making it far more difficult for the nation's largest wire service to provide essential coverage. The AP, to its great credit, has sued officials in the administration, saying it was doing so \"to vindicate its rights to the editorial independence guaranteed by the United States Constitution and to prevent the executive branch from coercing journalists to report the news using only government-approved language.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden has yet to rule on the AP's request but made it clear that the White House appeared to be improperly punishing the wire service for its editorial decision. \"It seems pretty clearly viewpoint discrimination,\" the judge said at a preliminary hearing.\n\nThis struggle is obviously about more than the name of a body of water; the White House wants to use coercion to control how it is covered and even who gets to cover the president. On Tuesday the press office said it would begin handpicking the news organizations that cover Trump as part of the press pool -- a decision that up to now was made by a group representing the news outlets themselves. The White House immediately cut Reuters and HuffPost from the pool and added two sycophantic outlets, Newsmax and The Blaze.\n\n\"The White House press pool exists to serve the public, not the presidency,\" said Bruce Brown, the executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.\n\nPoliticians are allowed to criticize the press -- that is free speech, too, and there is nothing new about it -- but there is a difference between using language and using muscle. Government officials are supposed to use their considerable regulatory powers for the benefit of the public, not for personal or partisan goals. This administration, however, is mustering the arms of government to suppress speech it doesn't like and compel words and ideas it prefers. It sees the press not as an institution with an explicit constitutional privilege but as a barrier to overcome, like an inspector general or a freethinking Republican senator. Members of Congress can be targeted for primaries, and inspectors general can be fired; under the same mentality, reporters need to be excluded and their bosses subjected to litigation.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nThe Trump administration's intention can be seen clearly by looking at the way it communicates with the public. All federal contracts, job descriptions and social media posts are being scrutinized for any hint of \"gender ideology,\" according to a memo from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management; federal employees \"whose position description involves inculcating or promoting gender ideology\" must be placed on leave.\n\nThe National Park Service erased the letters T and Q: from LGBTQ references on its website describing the Stonewall National Monument in New York City. More than 8,000 federal websites, in fact, have been taken down or altered to remove concepts derided by the MAGA movement. These include thousands of pages about vaccine research and sexually transmitted disease prevention guidelines, efforts to prevent hate crimes, prevention of racial discrimination in drug trials and disbursement of federal grants and details of environmental policies to slow climate change.\n\nThe government won't even describe its own museum collections as diverse. The word was eliminated from an Interior Department website describing federally owned works of art and natural history, though it has one of the broadest and most significant collections in the world.\n\nThe open hypocrisy on matters of speech is perhaps best exemplified by the actions of Musk, even before he became the Trump administration's designated wrecking ball to crucial institutions of government. Musk has every right to say what he wants on the social platform X, a forum owned by a private company. Describing himself as a \"free speech absolutist,\" he said he acquired Twitter in 2022 to create \"a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner.\" He seemed particularly agitated that the platform had dared to distinguish between lies -- like those about COVID vaccines and the 2020 election -- and verifiable truth.\n\nBut nearly immediately he began to demonstrate that the only free speech he championed was his own. Within a couple of months, he had suspended the accounts of journalists who had written critically about his business practices or the flights of his private plane. (So much for the hope he previously expressed that \"even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.\")\n\nThen he began suppressing access to posts with words like \"transgender\" and \"bisexual\" or ideas like Ukraine's battling against Russian aggression and made it more difficult for users of his platform to read articles from independent news organizations, including the Times and Reuters. Purveyors of hate speech were invited to return to Twitter, which he later renamed X, and when some critics advocated a boycott of the platform in response, he moved to block them. Musk even boosted his own pronouncements on X, forcing his posts to appear loudly even on the timelines of those who chose not to follow him.\n\nAnd when he couldn't quiet his critics, he sued them. He filed suit against Media Matters for America, a liberal media watchdog group that wrote about advertisements on X appearing next to neo-Nazi content, and then sued a group of prominent businesses, including Unilever and CVS, for what he said was an illegal advertising boycott of his platform. (Last year a federal judge threw out a similar lawsuit Musk brought against the Center for Countering Digital Hate.)\n\nWhen the magazine Wired published the names of six inexperienced young men working for Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, Musk falsely announced on X that publication of the names constituted a \"crime.\" And later, illustrating the connection between Musk's aims and those of the administration, one of the loyalists that Trump installed as a federal prosecutor in Washington made an inflammatory announcement that he would use his position in the Justice Department to defend claims that Musk had raised.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nThe administration's desire to control speech and thinking has extended to Congress, the military and college campuses. Among other recent examples:\n\n-- After the office of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., conducted a webinar instructing immigrants of their constitutional rights when challenged by federal officials, Tom Homan, the president's so-called border czar, said he had asked the Justice Department to investigate whether she crossed a legal red line by suggesting noncompliance with federal immigration officers.\n\n-- The Pentagon began pulling books off the shelves of school libraries used by the children of military families if they violated Trump's new rules on not speaking about gender or racial equity issues. Among the titles subject to military review are a picture book about Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and a book by actress Julianne Moore about a young girl coping with her freckles.\n\n-- In a fact sheet accompanying an executive order about antisemitism last month, Trump said he would deport legal immigrants if they joined in \"pro-jihadist protests\" and would cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses. \"We put you on notice,\" he wrote. \"Come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you.\" Supporting terrorism is always wrong, and antisemitism is vile in any form. Even some congressional Democrats cheered the executive order. What the administration is establishing, however, is a much more expansive legal definition of hate speech to include even just strident criticism of Israeli government policy.\n\nThe current administration may argue that these steps are simply payback for an American political left that can be rightly criticized for policing speech in recent years, from trying to shut or shout down conservative speakers to trying to enforce adherence to its own list of acceptable words and phrases like \"pregnant people,\" the \"unhoused,\" \"incarcerated individuals\" and \"Latinx.\"\n\nBut the Trump administration's early and furious reaction to criticism and pungent speech isn't just guilty of the same sins; it expands on them, worryingly, with the powers of the state. If the MAGA movement were really confident that the American public stood firmly behind the new intolerance, then why not welcome serious news reporting or even the jeers of critics and let the best ideas win? That seemed to be what Vance was advocating in recent remarks to the Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\n\"You do not have shared values if you're so afraid of your own people that you silence them and shut them up,\" he said.\n\nThe administration and the broader MAGA movement are demonstrating that they lack the confidence to permit free thinking by the American people. But those people still have the powers granted to them more than 230 years ago by the Bill of Rights to make themselves heard.\n\nAmericans have enormous ability and enviable creativity in finding ways to speak out against Trump's repressive and hypocritical speech regime, whether on social media or in the public square. The independence of AP and other organizations to make decisions contrary to government fiat should be defended and championed. Trump wants to redefine free speech with bans, bullying and fear. It's never been more necessary to speak up.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.", "summary": "The MAGA War on Speech", "url": "https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/editorials-of-the-times/article_42c9a1c2-a9c3-5c5e-aba5-f6e0d354d9d2.html", "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 05:30:35", "author": "Blox Content Management,The Editorial Board", "authors": ["Blox Content Management", "The Editorial Board"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.088}, {"id": 295534826, "title": "Sean Combs Faces Four New Sex Abuse Lawsuits, Filed in One Day", "text": "Four new sex abuse lawsuits have been filed against Sean Combs, including one from a woman who says she was assaulted while a contestant on a VH1 reality show in which people vied to be hired as the hip-hop mogul's personal assistant.\n\nThe new cases, which were filed Thursday in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, join the dozens of lawsuits that have been filed against Combs since Casandra Ventura, his former girlfriend, made bombshell allegations against him in November 2023. Ventura's suit was quickly settled, though at least 50 suits have followed hers with various accusations of sexual misconduct or violence. He has denied the allegations.\n\nIn September, Combs was also indicted on federal charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has denied those accusations and pleaded not guilty, and his trial is scheduled to begin in May.\n\nIn one of the new suits, Kendra Haffoney says that she was raped by Combs around 2008, while she was a contestant on VH1's \"I Want to Work for Diddy,\" which ran on the cable channel starting that year. On the show, various aspiring assistants tried to impress the demanding and mercurial Combs to earn a place as his right hand. Haffoney is credited with appearances on two episodes.\n\nIn her suit, she alleges that she was handed a spiked drink at an after-party in the SoHo area of Manhattan, where Combs and others were partying, and \"many sexual situations\" were underway, making her uncomfortable. She became delirious, the suit says, and Combs \"guided her head down\" to perform oral sex on him. She passed out and awoke later at the cast house, and \"knew that she had been sexually assaulted, raped\" by him, according to the court papers.\n\nAnother suit was filed by Justin Gooch, who said that in 1999, when he was 16, he met Combs at the Tunnel, then a popular dance club in Manhattan. The suit says that Combs gave him ecstasy and alcohol, and they then went to a bathroom, where Combs gave Gooch more drugs and \"anally penetrated\" him without his consent. According to the court papers, when he finished, Combs said to him, \"That wasn't so bad, was it?\"\n\nLeslie Cockrell, the plaintiff in a third suit filed Thursday, says that in 1999, she went to a party in the Hamptons, where Combs gave her a drink, and she became lightheaded and nauseous.\n\nThe plaintiff in the fourth suit, Aristalia Benitez accuses Combs \"and/or other unknown associates\" of assaulting her at a party at a New York restaurant, where she says Combs gave her what he said was a nonalcoholic drink that she believes contained drugs that caused her to lose consciousness.\n\nIn a statement, attorneys for Combs denied the allegations in all four suits.\n\n\"This is yet another example of false claims being filed against Mr. Combs,\" the statement said. \"No matter how many lawsuits are filed it won't change the fact that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone -- man or woman, adult or minor. We live in a world where anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason.\"\n\nThe four suits all cited the Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Protection Law, a New York City law enacted in 2000. An amendment to that law in 2022 created a temporary window in which people who believe they were victims of sexual assault could bring civil suits even if the statute of limitations for the alleged incidents had expired. The window is set to close at the beginning of March.\n\nLawyers and advocates have debated the bounds of the city law, along with the question of whether it conflicts with state laws that set similar look-back windows for allegations of abuse of both children and adults.\n\nSome judges have also drawn limits on the law. Last year, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of U.S. District Court in Manhattan dismissed a case against Steven Tyler, lead singer of rock band Aerosmith, who had been accused of aggressively kissing and groping a woman in the 1970s, when she was 17. Part of Kaplan's reasoning was that the city law was preempted by the state laws.\n\nIt also remains unclear whether accusations that predate the passage of the Gender-Motivated Violence law in 2000 can be brought under the recent window.

Canadian, Australian and New Zealand leaders added their voices to the Europeans'.\n\nEven as Western leaders generally shied away from explicitly criticizing Trump, who had told Zelenskyy he was \"not in a good position\" and angrily threatened to pull U.S. support for Ukraine unless he agreed to a ceasefire deal with Russia, many in Europe addressed their statements of encouragement directly to Zelenskyy.\n\n\"Your dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people,\" Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said on social media, referring to Zelenskyy. \"Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone, dear President.\"\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron of France, who had put on a display of friendship with Trump during a chummy visit to the White House on Monday, said the United States and Europe had been justified in aiding Ukraine and imposing sanctions on Russia after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago.\n\nIn a statement, Macron urged America to remain on the side of the Ukrainians, who he said were \"fighting for their dignity, their independence, their children, and the security of Europe.\"\n\nFriedrich Merz, who is on track to become Germany's next chancellor after the country's election this week, said in a statement addressed to \"Dear Volodymyr\" that his country would stand behind Ukraine \"in good and in testing times.\"\n\n\"We must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war,\" Merz added, apparently referring to Trump, who has called Zelenskyy a dictator and blamed him for the invasion. The departing German leader, Chancellor Olaf Scholz, said that Ukraine could rely on Germany and the rest of Europe.\n\nDaniel Fried, a career diplomat under U.S. presidents of both parties who had just returned from a trip to Brussels, said the Oval Office clash had jolted Europe's capitals, generated a wave of sympathy for Zelenskyy and upended a peace process that appeared to be gaining traction.\n\n\"The Europeans are horrified and dismayed,\" Fried said, adding that Europeans see the United States shifting to a great-power strategy in which large countries carve up the world. \"They're watching the America they know and respect change in a matter of a couple of weeks.\"\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, a center-left leader who carefully avoided any major disagreements with Trump during a visit to the White House on Thursday, spoke with Trump and Zelenskyy on Friday, according to the prime minister's office. Starmer \"retains his unwavering support for Ukraine and is playing his part to find a path forward to a lasting peace,\" the office said in a statement.\n\nStarmer is scheduled to host an international meeting on Ukraine on Sunday in London with Zelenskyy and other leaders from across Europe.\n\nPrime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, a right-wing nationalist who has long been at odds with much of Europe, appeared to side with Trump, saying on social media, \"Strong men make peace, weak men make war.\" He did not mention Ukraine or Zelenskyy in his post.\n\nTrump's upbraiding of Zelenskyy also predictably won praise in Russia. Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who is deputy chair of Russia's Security Council, said on Telegram that Trump had told \"the truth.\"\n\nCanadian Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly joined the European leaders in offering words of support for Ukraine, telling reporters that Ukrainians were \"fighting for their own freedoms, but also fighting for ours.\"\n\nJoly, whose country's relationship with Trump has been deeply strained by the U.S. president's threats to annex Canada and plans to impose tariffs, stressed the importance of maintaining Western unity over the war in Ukraine. She said that the Russians were watching.\n\nOn Saturday morning in Australia, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese echoed the messages of support from Europe. Albanese said his country was proud to help Ukraine defend itself against \"the brutality of Russian aggression.\"\n\nZelenskyy responded to each European leader on social media, writing, \"Thank you for your support.\"\n\nBut he offered his most ample statement of gratitude to Trump, who had said in the Oval Office earlier Friday that Zelenskyy was not \"acting at all thankful\" for American aid.\n\n\"Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit,\" wrote Zelenskyy, also thanking Trump, and adding, \"Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.", "summary": "European leaders quickly pledged their continued support for Ukraine on Friday after President Donald Trump's blistering criticism of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a meeting at the White House.", "url": "https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/europe-rallies-around-zelenskyy-after-explosive-white-house-meeting/article_e96005a3-851f-59da-9b8d-98566d5a9ea6.html", "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 04:34:49", "author": "Blox Content Management,Tim Balk", "authors": ["Blox Content Management", "Tim Balk"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.274}, {"id": 295534822, "title": "Berkshire County Real Estate Transactions for Feb. 10-14", "text": "Sincerity Builds LLC sold property at 47 Commercial St., Adams, to Radhe Group Realty LLC, $316,000.\n\nMarilyn J.

Then their differences started to be aired, unmistakably though not too contentiously. Then after 39 minutes, it really came off the rails.\n\nThe verbal brawl in the Oval Office on Friday between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy startled Washington, unnerved Europe, outraged Ukraine and delighted Russia. By the end, the Ukrainian ambassador to Washington had her head in her hands in dismay.\n\nBut what really seemed to get under Trump's skin during the discussion-turned-donnybrook were Zelenskyy's harsh words about Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump, who had nothing but good things to say about the master of the Kremlin, seemed offended on his behalf and scolded Zelenskyy for hostility toward the man who had invaded his country.\n\n\"He hates us,\" Zelenskyy told Trump, trying to explain that Putin was the aggressor, not the victim. \"It's not about me. He hates Ukrainians. He thinks we are not a nation.\" While Trump last week falsely said that Ukraine \"started\" the war, Zelenskyy made clear that Trump had that exactly wrong. \"Putin began this war,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nTrump did not concur, and proceeded to chide Zelenskyy for being mean. \"It's wonderful to speak badly about somebody else,\" said Trump, scorn in his voice, \"but I want to get it solved.\"\n\nTrump, who has been known to speak badly about plenty of somebody-elses, including Zelenskyy, whom he called a \"dictator\" just last week, offered no sympathy for the Ukrainian view.\n\n\"This is not a love match,\" he said, making clear he considered Zelenskyy to blame. \"This is why you're in this situation.\"\n\nA few moments later, Zelenskyy again cited Putin's role in the war and suggested that Trump was listening to the Russian leader too much. In response to Trump's comment that Ukrainian cities were destroyed, Zelenskyy said no, they had survived despite Russian bombardment.\n\n\"Maybe it's Putin who's sharing this disinformation that he destroyed us,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nTrump came to Putin's defense. \"He had to suffer through the Russia hoax,\" he said, referring to the investigation during his first term into Russian interference on Trump's behalf during the 2016 election. \"I think that he wants to make a deal and he'd like to see an end.\"\n\nIn fact, the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller was no hoax and concluded definitively that Putin ordered an intelligence operation to tilt the election eight years ago to Trump. Although Mueller said in his final report in 2019 that \"the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges,\" he made clear that Trump's campaign benefited from Russian assistance.\n\nThe Oval Office meeting Friday soon degenerated into a virtual showdown as Vice President JD Vance dispensed with any formalities and accused Zelenskyy of being \"disrespectful\" by offering the Ukrainian view of the war and what would be required for peace in the Oval Office with news cameras present. From there, Vance and Trump pummeled Zelenskyy for being insufficiently grateful, while he tried to get a word in.\n\nNever in at least the past few decades has a president engaged in such an angry, scathing attack on a visiting foreign leader in the Oval Office. Their argument culminated with a threat that if Zelenskyy did not accept whatever peace deal Trump brokered with Russia, the United States would abandon Ukraine. The fracas led Trump to kick Zelenskyy out of the White House. The schism upended plans to sign a deal giving the United States rights to Ukrainian rare minerals, a concession Trump had demanded as payback for help with the war.\n\nTrump often exhibits anger in public in ways other presidents have rarely done, particularly at rallies or in interviews. Just the other day, he snapped at the governor of Maine about transgender athletes. But he has never appeared so enraged and combative with a foreign visitor, especially a putative ally in the middle of a war for his country's survival.\n\nThe closest analogy might be a few meetings he had with congressional Democrats during his first term when he quarreled with Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker at the time, and Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader. At one of them, in fact, Pelosi famously stood, pointed a finger at him and snapped, \"All roads with you lead to Putin.\"\n\nEven so, that meeting was not on camera and those sessions never blew up quite like this one did, especially with so much at stake.\n\nTo be sure, Zelenskyy is not always a suave diplomatic player. He often irritated President Joe Biden and his team, who similarly chafed that the Ukrainian kept pushing them for more weapons without being grateful enough in their view for what they had done.\n\nZelenskyy does not have the defer-and-flatter gene that leads counterparts such as French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to play to the volatile Trump's ego and minimize their differences, as both did at the White House in separate meetings this week. Zelenskyy, leading a country that has been under attack for 11 years, even before the 2022 full-scale invasion, has little patience or instinct for diplomatic niceties.\n\nBut what was particularly striking in their exchange was how much Trump seemed insulted on Putin's behalf. He has long been an open admirer of Putin's and has rarely offered any criticism of his own. Just this week, he called Putin \"smart\" and \"cunning,\" and declined to call him a dictator even after calling Zelenskyy that.\n\n\"You want me to say really terrible things about Putin and then say, 'Hi, Vladimir, how are we doing on the deal?'\" Trump told Zelenskyy on Friday. \"It doesn't work that way.\"\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nHe did not explain why it was OK to say terrible things to Zelenskyy while pursuing a deal. Instead, he portrayed the Ukrainian leader as unreasonably distrustful of Putin, who has broken multiple agreements guaranteeing Ukrainian sovereignty and calling for ceasefires and now faces an international arrest warrant for war crimes.\n\n\"You see the hatred he's got for Putin,\" Trump said with a tone of indignation as cameras recorded the exchange. \"It's very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hate. He's got tremendous hatred. And I understand that. But I can tell you the other side's not exactly in love with him either.\"\n\nHe came back to Putin and the Russia investigation again near the end of the session, describing the Russian leader as if they had bonded through a shared ordeal. \"Putin went through a hell of a lot with me,\" Trump said. \"He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia.\"\n\nThe affront to Putin seemed to stick with Trump. By evening, hours after tossing Zelenskyy out of the White House, Trump stopped to talk with reporters as he left for a weekend in Florida and again outlined his grievance with the Ukrainian president.\n\n\"He's got to say, 'I want to make peace,'\" Trump said. \"He doesn't have to stand there and say about, 'Putin this, Putin that,' all negative things. He's got to say, 'I want to make peace.'\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.", "summary": "WASHINGTON -- It went well enough for the first 23 minutes, a polite if stiff meeting between a U.S. president and a foreign leader.

[+] Khalil Rountree Jr. in the UFC light heavyweight championship fight during the UFC 307 event at Delta Center on October 05, 2024 in Salt Lake City, Utah. (Photo by Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC)\n\nThe next pay-per-view card on the 2025 UFC schedule is fast approaching. That event, UFC 313, takes place on Saturday, March 8, from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, NV. In the main event, Alex Pereira looks to defend his UFC light heavyweight title for the fourth time when he meets Magomed Ankalaev inside the Octagon. The co-main event of the UFC 313 fight card is a rematch between former UFC BMF champion Justin Gaethje and Rafael Fiziev. Below, we look at everything you need to know about the UFC 313 fight card.\n\nUFC 313 Fight Card Main Event: Alex Pereira vs. Magomed Ankalaev\n\nSALT LAKE CITY, UTAH - OCTOBER 05: Alex Pereira of Brazil prepares to face Khalil Rountree Jr. in ... [+] the UFC light heavyweight championship fight during the UFC 307 event at Delta Center on October 05, 2024 in Salt Lake City, Utah. (Photo by Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC)\n\nAlex Pereira (12-2) began 2023 by losing his UFC middleweight title to Israel Adesanya by knockout. In July, Pereira followed that setback with a win over former UFC light heavyweight title holder, Jan B\u0142achowicz, in his UFC debut at 205 pounds. He finished the year by knocking out ex-UFC light heavyweight kingpin Ji\u0159\u00ed Proch\u00e1zka at UFC 295 to claim the vacant UFC 205-pound title.\n\nPereira made his first defense of his crown in April when he knocked out(another) ex-UFC light heavyweight champ, Jamahal Hill, in the first round of their UFC 300 matchup. Pereira showed his power is on another level, when he finished Hill 3:14 into the first round of the main event of UFC 300.\n\nIn June, on very short notice, the UFC called on Pereira and Proch\u00e1zka to headline UFC 303 when the Conor McGregor vs. Michael Chandler fight fell off that card.\n\nAfter the bout, which Pereira won via a knockout 13 seconds into the second stanza, I wrote:\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nPhysical Attacks Against Bitcoin Holders Surge As BTC Price Rises\n\nNew Guns, More Ammo: Ukraine\u2019s Artillery Blasts Away At A Rate Of Millions Of Shells A Year\n\nToday\u2019s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Saturday, March 1st\n\nPereira showed that his first win over Prochazka wasn't a fluke. The UFC light heavyweight champ is a fearsome fighter who packs a lot of power in his strikes, but he's also an extremely focused competitor who doesn't let anything bother him.\n\nPereira effectively scored two knockouts on Saturday night, blasting former champion Jiri Prochazka to the mat at the bell to end the first round and then sending him right back down in the opening moments of the second round with a head kick.\n\nIn August the UFC booked Pereira against Khalil Rountree Jr for the main event of UFC 307, which took place on October 5. Pereira outclassed Rountree, putting a beating on his opponent before scoring a fourth-round TKO win.\n\nPereira picked up his third UFC title defense of 2024 on Saturday night. Pereira let his opponent, Khalil Rountree Jr, tire himself out in the early going of the fight while simultaneously slowing him with powerful kicks to Rountree's lead leg. Pereira picked up the pace in the third round, fighting very effectively behind his jab. That jab opened up several nasty cuts around Rountree's eye and on the bridge of his nose. Those blows hurt Rountree, and once Pereira had Rountree fading, he picked him apart with precision and power, forcing the referee, Marc Goddard, to stop the fight in the fourth round. Goddard could have stopped this much sooner.\n\nPereira was in the running for fighter of the year for 2024.\n\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - OCTOBER 26: Magomed Ankalaev of Russia prepares to face Aleksandar ... [+] Rakic of Austria in a light heavyweight fight during the UFC 308 event at Etihad Arena on October 26, 2024 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC)\n\nMagomed Ankalaev (19-1-1-1) has been a member of the UFC roster since 2018. Ankalaev lost his UFC debut when Paul Craig submitted him at 4:59 of the third round. Since then, Ankalaev has gone 13 fights without a loss.\n\nAnkalaev secured a title fight in December 2022 when he faced former UFC champion Jan Blachowicz for the vacant light heavyweight crown. However, that contest ended in a split draw, and with neither man impressing the matchmakers in that matchup, the UFC opted not to give either man a second go at earning the belt.\n\nSince then, Ankalaev is 2-0-0-1 with a no contest (illegal knee) against Johnny Walker, and most recently a decision win over Aleksandar Rakic at UFC 308.\n\nWhen the UFC opted to give UFC light heavyweight champion Alex Pereira a fight against Khalil Rountree at UFC 307 and bypass Ankalaev, he felt snubbed by the promotion, but also motivated.\n\n\u201cNow everybody knows I'm not fighting for the title and will fight Rakic in Abu Dhabi. Whoever (UFC matchmaker) Mick Maynard gives me I will smash their face so that they can no longer deny me if I do my job impressively. I feel sorry for whoever is gonna fight me from now going forward,\u201d Ankalaev said at the time.\n\nNot long after that, Ankalaev said that Pereira was running from him.\n\nAt UFC 313, Ankalaev gets his long awaited shot at Pereira.\n\nUFC 313 Fight Card Co-Main Event: Justin Gaethje Vs. Rafael Fiziev\n\nLONDON, ENGLAND - MARCH 18: (L-R) Justin Gaethje punches Rafael Fiziev of Kazakstan in a lightweight ... [+] fight during the UFC 286 event at The O2 Arena on March 18, 2023 in London, England. (Photo by Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images)\nZuffa LLC via Getty Images\n\nWhen Justin Gaethje (25-5) joined the UFC in 2017 he had a perfect record of 17-0. Leading up to that signing, Gaethje had won the World Series of Fighting lightweight title and then defended the belt five times. All six of his title fights under the WSOF banner ended by knockout.\n\nGaethje\u2019s first fight with the UFC came in July 2017, when he met Michael Johnson in the main event of The Ultimate Fighter 25 finale card. Expectations were high for that matchup, and Gaethje delivered, picking up a second-round TKO win over Johnson and earning \u201cFight of the Night\u201d and \u201cPerformance of the Night\u201d bonuses for a contest that won several \u201cFight of the Year\u201d polls for 2017.\n\nEvery UFC fight Gaethje has been involved in since has been viewed with anticipation as he has one of the most fan-friendly styles in the history of not just the UFC but all of MMA. Gaethje might not win every time he steps into the octagon, but he is a fighter always looking to earn a stoppage win and entertain the fans. His 12 fight-night bonus awards in 12 UFC outings can attest to that.\n\nGaethje won the interim UFC lightweight crown in May 2020 with a knockout win over Tony Ferguson. However, he failed to unify the belts, losing to then-champion Khabib Nurmagomedov by submission in October of that year. Gaethje also fell short in his second try at winning the UFC 155-pound belt, dropping a submission to Charles Oliveira for the vacant title in May 2022.\n\nGaethje bounced back from that loss with his majority decision victory over Fiziev at UFC 286.

At the time he had a 6-0 record with six stoppages (five knockouts and one submission), with all but one of those fights ending in the first round. Fiziev\u2019s UFC debut ended 86 seconds into the first round when he caught a spinning back kick from Magomed Mustafaev, who had not fought for more than two years.\n\nFiziev bounced back from his first career loss by going on a six-fight unbeaten streak. He climbed the rankings during that run, which began with an October 2019 decision win over Alex White and ended with a July 2022 knockout win over former UFC lightweight champion Rafael dos Anjos. Fiziev picked up five fight-night bonuses during that stretch.\n\nWith his impressive run, Fiziev earned the No. 6 spot in the official UFC rankings. His reward was a matchup against Gaethje in the co-main event of UFC 286. Fiziev entered that bout as a -230 betting favorite over the +195 Gaethje.\n\nThe two put on a striking battle over three rounds in front of an appreciative crowd in London that evening. In the end, Gaethje earned the majority decision win. In his next outing, Fiziev faced Mateusz Gamrot in a UFC Fight Night main event. That contest ended abruptly in the second round when Gamrot scored a TKO win after Fiziev planted his leg to throw a kick and dropped to the canvas.\n\nFiziev has not fought since he tore his ACL in that contest, even though he was cleared for action in September 2024.

[+] secure an IMF loan, in Quito, on October 11, 2019.\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nThe Mexican government recently reached an agreement with gasoline retailers to voluntarily cap gasoline prices at 24 pesos per liter ($4.50 per gallon). While this measure may make political sense\u2014and the Mexican government is hardly alone in this calculation\u2014it contradicts well-established research on how best to support low-income households facing rising energy costs.\n\nMost policy experts advocate for eliminating fuel subsidies and price caps because they primarily benefit wealthier households, encourage wasteful consumption, increase carbon emissions, and place a heavy burden on government budgets.\n\nA more effective approach is to allow fuel prices to reflect market conditions while providing direct cash assistance to households most affected by price increases. This ensures that low-income families receive the support they need without artificially lowering prices for everyone. Additionally, because targeted cash transfers cost less than subsidies, governments can redirect funds toward more productive investments, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure.\n\nThis strategy is supported by academic research and endorsed by global and regional institutions, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Inter-American Development Bank, the OECD, and the International Energy Agency (IEA). Whenever a country faces ballooning deficits or seeks to reduce carbon emissions, the recommendation is consistently the same: stop subsidizing fuel and instead use the savings to provide targeted financial assistance.\n\nYet, despite their inefficiencies, fuel subsidies remain widespread. IMF researchers estimate that \u201c70% of gasoline consumption is priced at less than 60% of efficient levels, while 50% of diesel is priced at less than half the efficient level.\u201d An \u201cefficient\u201d price would account not only for the market value of these fuels but also for the carbon taxes necessary to mitigate pollution.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nPhysical Attacks Against Bitcoin Holders Surge As BTC Price Rises\n\nNew Guns, More Ammo: Ukraine\u2019s Artillery Blasts Away At A Rate Of Millions Of Shells A Year\n\nToday\u2019s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Saturday, March 1st\n\nIf fuel subsidies are inefficient and costly, why do governments persist with them? Why do politicians who claim to champion working families end up subsidizing the wealthy? And why do they spend taxpayer dollars to artificially suppress fuel prices, despite the resulting overconsumption and environmental damage?\n\nWhy Fuel Subsidies Persist\n\nOne major factor behind the persistence of fuel subsidies is politics. It\u2019s no surprise that cheap fuel wins votes. People notice lower prices at the pump, on heating bills, and in everyday expenses\u2014and they often credit the government for keeping costs down. While wealthier households consume more fuel and thus reap the largest share of subsidies, lower-income families still feel some relief, albeit to a lesser extent. This allows governments to claim they are helping everyone, even when subsidies primarily benefit those who need them the least.\n\nRaising fuel prices is also politically risky. An IMF team that analyzed 101 developing countries between 2001 and 2020 found that fuel price hikes are strongly linked to social unrest and anti-government protests. Countries with weak economic growth, high inflation, widespread corruption, and fragile institutions face the greatest risk.\n\nResearchers from Uppsala University in Sweden, after examining data from 2003 to 2015, concluded in an article published in World Development that fuel price protests are even more likely in oil-producing countries, where citizens expect state-owned companies to provide fuel at a discount.\n\nAnd another research team, using data from 2015 to 2022, observed in an article available in Energy Research and Social Science that poor income distribution correlates with social unrest when fossil fuel subsidies are removed. In these cases, raising prices can trigger public anger\u2014even when subsidies are fiscally unsustainable.\n\nAnother reason fuel subsidies persist is misinformation. Many people believe subsidies are fairer than cash assistance, likely because they are more visible. A survey analysis published in Energy Research & Social Science examined public attitudes toward fuel subsidies and cash transfers in the U.K. and France during the 2022 energy crisis, when prices spiked after Russia invaded Ukraine. Initially, respondents in both countries preferred subsidies. Their preference was linked to unfounded perceptions that cash recipients misuse their funds on alcohol and tobacco or work less. However, when presented with data showing that subsidies disproportionately benefit the wealthy\u2014and that the poor do not misuse their cash\u2014support for subsidies declined in the U.K. and shifted toward cash transfers in France. This suggests that public opposition to reform often stems from a lack of information rather than deep ideological differences.\n\nA variant of this challenge involves concerns about corruption and government competence, which erode public trust. Many people fear that cutting fuel subsidies will lead to higher prices without delivering the promised compensation, especially in countries with a history of corruption and broken promises. This was the case in Indonesia in 2013, according to an article published in Comparative Political Studies based on survey data. Additional examples of this problem are not hard to find.\n\nA final challenge is administrative. Implementing cash transfers requires robust financial infrastructure, reliable digital payment systems, and well-managed social programs\u2014including clear identification and registration processes for intended beneficiaries. Not all governments have these systems in place. Economists at the IDB found, for example, that many cash transfer programs in Latin America fail to reach most households\u2014only 50% receive them, and 40% of recipients are not poor\u2014underscoring the need for broad coverage and careful planning.\n\nGlobal Lessons On Fuel Subsidies\n\nGovernments that have successfully replaced fuel subsidies with cash transfers follow a few key principles. They clearly explain their plan, ensuring the public understands the implementation strategy, who will receive compensation, and how much. They provide broad eligibility to avoid resentment and distribute cash transfers before price hikes take effect. They also coordinate across agencies to ensure smooth implementation and balance short-term fiscal relief with long-term investments.\n\nFor instance, Iran and Ecuador failed to follow these principles, unlike the Dominican Republic.\n\nA review of Iran\u2019s 2010 fuel subsidy reform available in Economic Research Forum discusses how it went form promise to disappointment. Initially, the program succeeded because the government deposited two months\u2019 worth of cash transfers into household bank accounts before gradually increasing fuel prices. It provided a $90 monthly compensation to all families, regardless of income. However, because the transfers were too large and partially financed by printing money\u2014and economic sanctions reduced the availability of fiscal resources\u2014the program unraveled within a few years. Inflation eroded purchasing power, and the reform lost public support.\n\nWhen the Iranian government attempted another fuel subsidy reform in 2019, it displayed little learning from the previous experience, making critical mistakes: it excluded 30% of households (including the middle class that supported the government) and failed to provide a clear process for registering beneficiaries. Fuel prices tripled overnight, leading to confusion, anger, and mass protests that forced the government to backtrack.\n\nEcuador\u2019s 2019 attempt to remove fuel subsidies in exchange for an IMF loan failed in part because the government permitted a 25% price increase before putting cash assistance in place, according to a research paper published by the Pathfinders initiative at New York University\"s Center on International Coopertation. The mistake sparked violent protests by indigenous peoples and forced a complete reversal of the policy.\n\nThe Dominican Republic achieved success by engaging in public communication campaigns, consulting key stakeholders, and keeping fiscal discipline. A World Bank technical report on cash transfers in the context of fuel energy reform shows how, beginning in 2004, the government gradually adjusted electricity prices, and in 2008, it introduced a phased increase in LPG prices. Low-income households received cash transfers through Bonogas and Bonoluz, voucher-like programs for LPG (used for cooking and taxi transport) and electricity. Crucially, these reforms took place during a period of macroeconomic stability, enabling smoother implementation.\n\nAn Effective System For Cash Transfers Is Key\n\nUltimately, transitioning away from fuel subsidies requires a reliable system for delivering cash transfers. Until 2018, the Mexican government had a renowned system of conditional cash transfers to the poor, but recent reforms have resulted in more resources being directed to the wealthy than to the poor, according to an analysis by CONEVAL, a Mexican think tank. Paying close attention to past lessons and improving how benefits are targeted would increase the likelihood of success if Mexico\u2019s government\u2014or any other\u2014 eventually opts for a full-fledged fuel subsidy reform.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades", "summary": "Fuel subsidies encourage wasteful consumption, increase carbon emissions, and place a heavy burden on government budgets.

The avalanche occurred around 7.15 a.m., near the workers' camp, approximately 3 km ahead of Badrinath Dham, where workers were clearing snow for army movement. The Army's swift response teams, including over 100 personnel from the Ibex Brigade, doctors, ambulances, and heavy equipment, were immediately mobilised. However, ongoing snowfall and intermittent smaller avalanches are slowing rescue efforts, which are being conducted with extreme caution. The General Reserve Engineer Force (GERF) is also working to clear the road between Joshimath and Mana, while additional medical resources from Joshimath are being mobilised. The rescue operations are being carried out by multiple agencies, including the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), the Border Roads Organisation (BRO), the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), and the Army. Union Home Minister Amit Shah has spoken to Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, DG ITBP, and DG NDRF regarding the Chamoli avalanche. He stated, Our priority is to safely evacuate those trapped. The local administration is engaged in full-scale rescue efforts. Two NDRF teams are also en route. Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami expressed deep concern over the tragedy, stating, Sad news has been received about workers being buried under an avalanche during BRO's construction work near Mana. Rescue operations by ITBP, BRO, and other teams are in full swing. I pray to Lord Badri Vishal for everyone's safety. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also posted about the unfortunate incident, stating that the administration is providing all possible assistance, and the Army is leading rescue efforts with all available resources. District Magistrate Sandeep Tiwari has directed officials to expedite the rescue mission. He confirmed that 57 workers were engaged in clearing snow for army movement when the avalanche struck. So far, no fatalities have been reported. A team of the SDRF has been dispatched from Joshimath, while a high-altitude rescue team remains on standby at Sahastradhara helipad, awaiting improved weather for aerial deployment. The Army has also been contacted to clear blocked routes in Lambagad. Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an orange alert for Uttarakhand and other hilly regions, warning of extremely heavy snowfall - up to 20 cm - until late Friday night. Rescue teams continue to battle challenging conditions as efforts intensify to locate and save the trapped workers. This incident is reminiscent of the Uttarkashi tunnel collapse in November 2023, where 41 workers were trapped for 17 days before being successfully rescued. The massive multi-agency operation, which also involved some international experts, achieved its mission following days of setbacks. The final piece of the puzzle, the last pipe to create the escape path for the trapped men, was laid by manual drilling after the American-made Auger machine broke down on the weekend. The Silkyara tunnel is located on the Yamunotri National Highway near Silkyara and is part of the Chardham Highway Project.", "summary": "A massive avalanche has struck the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand, leaving 57 road construction workers missing near Mana village, close to the India-Tibet border, with rescue teams scrambling to locate survivors.

It brought together global AI experts from Silicon Valley, the United Arab Emirates, India, and beyond to discuss how nations can navigate the fast-evolving AI landscape amid groundbreaking investments in infrastructure. One of the summit's highlights was a fireside chat featuring Navin Chaddha, Managing Partner of the Menlo Park, California-based Mayfield Fund, which invests in early and growth-stage companies. In the inaugural session, Chaddha spoke with Indiaspora Founder and Chairman MR Rangaswami on \"The Era of Collaborative Intelligence.\" Stressing that people, not markets, drive lasting innovation, he said, \"We are a firm which invests in people, not in markets. Because at the stage we invest, our belief is people build products, people build companies, waves can come and go. If you bet on A-plus people who are aligned with your values, their initial idea may not pan out, but eventually they [will]. So we are making bets on the jockeys, not the horse, and when we talk about AI, it's a horse. At the end, humans will win.\" When asked by Rangaswami why he was so optimistic about AI, Chaddha described it as a tool that will enhance, rather than replace, human capabilities. \"I don't look at it as it's going to take over jobs, I look at it... as collaborative intelligence, machines and humans will work together to elevate humans to super humans, they will help, yes, already in factories and everything, automation has happened, efficiency has happened, but now, using AI and machines, they will be able to do jobs, we don't want to do, we can't do.\" Reflecting on his long career in Silicon Valley, Chaddha \u2014 who holds a master's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University and a B.Tech in electrical engineering from IIT Delhi and has made 12 appearances on the Forbes Midas List of Top 100 Tech Investors \u2014 noted that he had never witnessed anything on the scale of the current AI revolution.

He accused the Centre of penalising southern states that effectively controlled population growth. In a video message shared on X, Stalin stated, \"The Centre claims it is not imposing its will on the state, but its actions suggest otherwise. Delimitation will affect Tamil Nadu's self-respect, social schemes, and people's welfare.\" The delimitation process, expected next year, is likely to result in a significant reshaping of parliamentary constituencies. While northern states with higher population growth may gain seats, Tamil Nadu is projected to see only a marginal increase despite its efforts in population control. The issue has sparked a political row, with Stalin urging Tamil Nadu residents to oppose what he termed an unfair redistribution of parliamentary representation. As part of his birthday celebrations, CM Stalin distributed chocolates to schoolchildren at the Muthamizharignar Dr. Kalaignar M. Karunanidhi Memorial.

In response, Zelensky appeared to implore the two American leaders to reconsider their position by claiming that Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly breached ceasefire agreements, illegally occupying Ukrainian territory in the Crimean peninsula and violating human rights. The tense encounter, which left the Ukrainian leader visibly uncomfortable, has since sparked a fierce backlash not just across Washington but also beyond. The dramatic scenes inside the Oval Office prompted Trump's opponents to accuse him of holding a pro-Russian position on the ongoing Russia- Ukraine war. Democrats have condemned Trump and Vance's actions as an appeasement of Russian President Vladimir Putin, while Republicans defended their approach as putting \"America First.\"(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");A Democratic party leader from Massachusetts even went on to say that Zelensky \"flew to Washington but walked into the Kremlin\" in the aftermath of the fiery meeting. \"What we saw in the Oval Office today was beyond disgraceful. Trump and Vance berating Zelensky- putting on a show of lies and misinformation that would make Putin blush-is an embarrassment for America and a betrayal of our allies. They're popping champagne in the Kremlin,\" wrote Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen.Republicans, however, saw the Oval Office confrontation as a necessary shift in US policy, arguing that Ukraine must recognise the limits of American support.\"Thanks to President Trump-the days of America being taken advantage of and disrespected are OVER... What we witnessed in the Oval Office today was an American President putting America first,\" said House Speaker Mike Johnson\"Thank you @POTUS for standing up for America in a way that no President has ever had the courage to do before. Thank you for putting America First. America is with you!\" wrote Secretary of State Marco Rubio on social media. How the Clash UnfoldedTensions had already been high before the meeting. Trump and Zelensky have long had a strained relationship, exacerbated by Trump's push for a diplomatic settlement with Russia and his past questioning of US aid to Ukraine under former President Joe Biden's administration. The meeting began with polite exchanges over minerals trade agreements, but after more than 30 minutes of discussion, Vice President Vance shifted the focus to something else. Urging Zelensky to consider negotiations with Russia, he argued that Ukraine was prolonging a war it could not win.Zelensky responded by pointing out Russia's repeated violations of past agreements, but Vance, sitting calmly on a couch opposite him, accused the Ukrainian leader of being \"disrespectful\" and of failing to express gratitude for US military assistance.Trump quickly escalated the confrontation, raising his voice and warning Zelensky that the United States would abandon him if he refused to negotiate a peace deal with Russia.Zelensky later reflected on the encounter in a Fox News interview, saying he hoped the relationship with the US could be repaired. However, he took aim at Vance's role in the clash: \"With all due respect to the vice president, I mean, he has his own interviews.\"In the wake of the Oval Office clash, European leaders rushed to reassure Ukraine of their continued support.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk: \"You are not alone.\"British Prime Minister Keir Starmer: \"I reaffirm unwavering support for Ukraine.\"Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni: \"A summit without delay is needed between the United States, European states and their allies to talk frankly about how we intend to tackle today's major challenges, starting with Ukraine, which together we have defended in recent years,\" Meloni said in a statement.Russia, however, reveled in the discord. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev mocked Zelensky as an \"insolent pig\" who had been \"properly slapped down in the Oval Office.\"Ukraine, for its part, stood firmly behind its president. The country's military leadership vowed to continue fighting, while Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba praised Zelensky's \"bravery\" in standing up to Trump and Vance.", "summary": "The White House meeting between US President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday was supposed to focus on minerals-sharing agreements and US support for Ukraine's war against Russia.", "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-volodymyr-zelensky-jd-vance-putin-flew-to-washington-walked-into-kremlin-a-clash-that-shook-the-world-7821416", "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-03/676nc45_trump-zelensky-afp-_625x300_01_March_25.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 05:49:00", "author": "Samiran Mishra", "authors": ["Samiran Mishra"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.416}, {"id": 295549736, "title": "Intimate Affairs: When his side chick has extra powers", "text": "By Funke Egbemode \n\nI caught a friend adding oil from a small bottle and water from another smaller bottle to her mouth-watering pot of ogbono soup. My first thought was: caught you, girl, so these are your secret ingredients. But she looked at me strangely and told me the soup was for her husband. She lifted the lid of another pot and lo and behold, it was another pot of ogbono. I was still processing my shock and confusion when her husband arrived. She dished the soup with the \u2018special ingredients\u2019 for her husband and the \u2018plain\u2019 soup for me. I told her I had a quick errand to run, trying to flee a developing crime scene, of course. My friend smiled and assured me there was nothing to fear. We all ate at the dining table and nobody died, contrary to my expectation. What just happened? My friend later explained.\n\n\u201cMy marriage is not what it used to be. My husband is seeing another woman. This time it is serious. This new woman is unlike the other ones. He has been seeing her for close to a year. His secretary is my reliable source and she told me they have even taken a foreign trip together. What am I supposed to do, fold my arms and wait until he moves in with her or move her in with us? What you saw in the kitchen was part of my efforts to hold on to my man and retrieve him from the claws of another woman.\u201d\n\nHoly water, anointing oil in ogbono soup! Is she right or wrong? Perhaps the question should even be: is she doing enough?\n\nA peaceful marriage can become toxic overnight and when it does, what is a woman supposed to do, quit or fight? The easiest solution is to take a walk, walk away if a marriage becomes life-threatening. Verbal abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse are all toxic. They are also common, and over the years, different types of solutions and coping methods have been proffered. But there is a new one, a less-talked-about abuse and toxicity: spiritual abuse or diabolic toxicity. When juju, jazz shows up in marriage, what is a wife supposed to do?\n\nThere are side chicks or mistresses who deploy good food and irresistible sex to establish themselves in the lives of a man. They pamper him with both so much the man forgets the wife he \u2018begged to marry\u2019 at home. Those ones are still easy to deal with but when a husband and father of three meets the one that seizes his manhood, what is the wife supposed to do? I mean, if the man suddenly can no longer use his rod of authority to part his wife\u2019s red sea but at his side chick\u2019s place, he can move mountains, what is the way forward? Yeah, it has been known to happen. Did you just say it is erectile dysfunction? Should his erection malfunction in one place and not the other? Why should an erection rise to the occasion when it sees just the cleavage of one woman and refuse to wake up even when it is being pulled like a faulty Tiger I-pass-my-neighbour generator?\n\nREAD ALSO: Intimate Affairs: When a side chick decides to move on\n\nRomoke, who has been married for 20 years, noticed she could no longer start her husband\u2019s generator. She put it down to the anti-hypertension drugs he was taking. Then she blamed it on the common culprit, erectile dysfunction. She tweaked his diet, made special herbal drinks for him but the third leg remained lame. She was about to resign herself to fate when she heard that her husband was not just having an affair but he had actually gone to pay the bride price of another woman! What? Without a functional manhood? She launched a comprehensive investigation. Don\u2019t ask me for the details. What followed was an emergency extended family meeting where the new wife, Romoke\u2019s husband and indeed everybody younger than Romoke knelt and prostrated to beg her to have mercy. Well, what Romoke found out sent her into a juju rage.\n\n\u201cI found out that the little witch my husband had gone and married was the one who seized my husband\u2019s thing for her own exclusive use. That was the reason my husband could no longer make love to me and instead of the old fool to find a solution, he left me high and dry while he was getting all the sex he wanted from the second wife. Well, two can play the game. I also made sure he could not get an erection at all. If he would not have sex with me, then he would never have sex again. That was why they came to beg. I pretended that I did not know what they were accusing me of but later that night, he came to my bed, performed his duties vigorously and made up for lost time.\u201d\n\nI called that strategy by Romoke balance of terror. Dangerous, mean, sad and bad but what would you have done especially if you have the wherewithal to show the other woman that you could meet her half way?\n\nHowever, where a \u2018jazzed up\u2019 atmosphere becomes more than a woman can cope with, I will advise that she puts herself first and forget all that bunkum about \u2018what will people say\u2019. White science may not be able to place or define black magic, it is a reality of our spiritual environment. If a woman feels like she is fortified enough to face marauders\u2019 invasion of her marital territory, by all means, she should show the stuff she is made of. Where she feels that her life and that of her children are being endangered by dark stuff, she should run so that she can live to fight later. Some 30-year-old women have walked the dark edges of this earth and dined with \u2018the owners of the world\u2019 so intimately that even 55-year-old \u2018owners of the house\u2019 look like a mess of pottage when those \u2018young side chicks\u2019 come after their marriages. These are young \u2018spirits\u2019 who torment and threaten both at noon and in the dream. Forget their 22-inch Brazilian wigs and manicured nails, no \u2018madam is too big for them to devour for breakfast or brunch. If those ones want your husband, lady, just retreat and let them. Open battles with them, unless a wife is kitted by a higher power, usually end up with Madam\u2019s face on a gone-too-soon poster.\n\nWhen Laide noticed that her husband had gone and brought a basket-load of cobwebs to the house with his head, she knew she had to ferry her children to safety. Her nightmares were not limited to night times. Domestic accidents became too regular to be called accidents. Laide\u2019s husband became a stranger she could not recognize. The gentleman she married overnight became violent.\n\n\u201cIt was not so much the beating that was frightening but this strange glazed look in his eyes, as if he was not in control of himself. This was a man who had never raised his voice, least of all his hands, against me in 10 years. He just suddenly became dangerous, not just violent. He would pin me down on the bed and hold my neck in a vice grip and then just as suddenly as he started, that glazed look would clear and he would apologise. Of course, I had the option of waiting around to figure it out and defend my home but I also knew he could kill me one day and plead insanity. One morning, I went to work and didn\u2019t return. He brought home a new woman the following month. Three years later, his new \u2018wife\u2019 took off with everything he had to his name and relocated abroad. Now, he wants me back.\u201d\n\nIf Laide had stayed to battle the enemy and defend her territory, there was a huge chance of her children becoming stepchildren of the \u2018enemy\u2019. Some marital battles are better fought later, not now. When the toxicity is laced with jazz, run. You may return later if the man you wanted to fight for had not \u2018gone too soon\u2019.\n\n*Egbemode (egbemode3@gmail.com)\n\nREAD ALSO: \n\nLawmakers removed Obasa without consulting party leadership \u2013 GAC Chairman\nKogi Central warns against political persecution of Senator Natasha\nEx-NYSC DG Tsiga remains in captivity 23 days after abduction\nIntimate Affairs: When his side chick has extra powers\nTales From Public Hearing on Tax Reform Bills", "summary": "By Funke Egbemode I caught a friend adding oil from a small bottle and water from another smaller bottle to her mouth-watering pot of ogbono soup.

All the tensions that have bubbled since Trump spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 12 boiled over -- and not behind closed doors, but in the full glare of the world's media, including AFP journalists.\"You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. You're gambling with World War III, and what you're doing is very disrespectful to this country,\" Trump said.Red faced and furious, Trump wagged his finger at Zelensky as his voice rose higher. At one point he lightly shoved Zelensky's upper arm with his hand as he made his points.'Great television'For Zelensky it turned into an ambush, as the gruff-voiced Ukrainian kept trying to make his points while Trump berated him. \"Please, you think that if you will speak very loudly...,\" he said to Vance at one point, before Trump leapt in.\"He's not speaking loudly,\" said Trump. When Zelensky asked if he could answer, Trump continued: \"No, no, you've done a lot of talking. Your country is not winning.\" The US president -- long skeptical of US support for Kyiv -- then delved into a litany of grievances about Ukraine. Trump even expressed solidarity with Kremlin chief Putin.\"Let me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me, he went through a phony witch hunt,\" said Trump, referring to an investigation during his first term into whether his 2016 election campaign colluded with Moscow.As the clash continued for some five minutes, reporters frantically filmed and tapped on their phones, while a Ukrainian diplomat buried her head in her hands.\"You're either going to make a deal or we're out,\" said Trump, making clear that this breach was real.Finally Trump called a halt and journalists were escorted out. An hour or so later, Zelensky abruptly left the White House and a minerals deal signing ceremony was canceled.The collapse of US support for Ukraine against Russia, at least for now, had played out in real time. In Moscow, the Kremlin rubbed its hands, hailing Trump's \"restraint\" against \"scumbag\" Zelensky.But for Trump, ever the political showman, some instincts die hard.\"This is going to be great television, I will say that,\" he said as the meeting wrapped up.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)", "summary": "It all seemed to be going so well.

He stated that Zelenskyy should apologize for \"turning this thing into the fiasco for him that it became.\" Rubio's remarks followed Zelenskyy's verbal clash with US President Donald Trump and Vice President Vance at the White House on Friday (local time). This shouting match between the leaders was witnessed by White House officials, mediapersons and other Ukrainian officials. In an interview with CNN, Rubio said that there was no need for Zelenskyy to \"go in there and become antagonistic.\" He stressed that Trump wants to bring an end to the conflict and wants to get Russians to a negotiating table. Asked whether he feels otherwise on Zelenskyy's statement that he does not believe he owes an apology, Rubio said, \"I do, I do because you guys don't see. You guys only saw the end. You saw what happened today? You don't see all the things that led up to this. So, let me explain the president's been very clear, he campaigned on this. He thinks this war should have never started. He believes, and I agree, that had he been president it never would have happened. Now, here we are. He's trying to bring an end to this conflict. We've explained very clearly what our plan is here, which is we want to get the Russians to a negotiating table. We want to explore whether peace is possible. They understand this. They also understand that this agreement that was supposed to be signed today was supposed to be an agreement that binds America economically to Ukraine, which to me, as I've explained, I think the president alluded to today is a security guarantee in its own way because we're involved, it's not us, it's our interests. That was all explained. That was all understood.\" \u2018Stand With Ukraine\u2019: Leaders Worldwide Back Ukraine\u2019s Fight After Donald Trump-Volodymyr Zelensky Oval Office Clash. \"And nonetheless, for the last ten days and every engagement we've had with the Ukrainians, there's been complications in getting that point across, including the public statements that President Zelenskyy has made. But they insisted on coming to DC. This agreement could have been signed five days ago, but they insisted on coming to Washington. And it was a very and should have been a very clear understanding, don't come here and create a scenario where you're going to start lecturing us about how diplomacy isn't going to work. So, as President Zelenskyy took it in that direction and it ended in a predictable outcome as a result. It's unfortunate that was supposed to be this way, but that's the path he chose. And I think, frankly, you know, sends his country backwards in regards to achieving peace, which is what President Trump wants at the end of the day, is for this war to end. He's been as consistent as anyone can be about what his objective is here,\" he added. Speaking to CNN, he said that the verbal clash between the leaders started after Zelenskyy asked Vance on what kind of diplomacy they are talking about. Rubio said the meeting went \"off the rails\" after that interaction. Asked on what does he want to see Zelenskyy apologise for, Rubio stated, \"Well, apologize for turning this thing into the fiasco for him that it became. There was no need for him to go in there and become antagonistic. Look, this thing went off the rails. You were there, I believe it went off the rails when he said, let me ask you a question to the vice president, What kind of diplomacy are you talking about? Well, this this is a serious thing. I mean, thousands of people have been killed. Thousands and he talks about all these horrible things that have happened to prisoners of war and children. All true, all bad. This is what we're dealing with here. It needs to come to an end. We are trying to bring it to an end.\" \"The way you bring it to an end is you get Russia to the table to talk, and he understands that attacking Putin, no matter how anyone may feel about him personally, forcing the president into a position where you're trying to go to him into attacking Putin, calling him names, maximalist demands about Russia having to pay for the reconstruction, all the sorts of things that you talk about in a negotiation when you start talking about that aggressively and the president's a dealmaker. He's made deals his entire life. You're not going to get people to the table. And so you start to perceive that maybe Zelenskyy doesn't want a peace deal. He says he does, but maybe he doesn't and that active open undermining of efforts to bring about peace is deeply frustrating for everyone who's been involved in communications with them leading up to today. And I think the campaign for wasting our time for a meeting that was going to end the way it did,\" he added. After Oval Office Blowout With Donald Trump, Ukrainians Rally Around Volodymyr Zelenskyy as Defender of Ukraine's Interests. The Oval Office meeting began with warm exchanges and handshakes, with Trump at one point saying of Zelensky: \"I think he's a great guy.\" But matters took an ugly turn after Zelensky attempted to explain Russian President Vladimir Putin's lack of diplomacy to Vance in a heated confrontation in front of live cameras and journalists. US Vice President accused Zelenskyy of \"litigating\" in front of the world's press, criticized him for taking part in photo-ops with Democrats during the 2024 campaign, and said his remarks were \"disrespectful\" to the administration. Raising his voice, Trump called the Ukrainian president \"disrespectful\" and told him he should be thanking the US, saying, \"You don't have the cards.\" \"You are either going to make a deal or we're out and if we are out, you will fight it out. I don't think it's going to be pretty,\" he added. Trump and Zelensky were set to sign a deal that would have created a joint US-Ukraine fund investing in extracting the country's rare-earth mineral supply. Friday's meeting was supposed to ink a deal on rare earth minerals which are used to make a variety of tech products.

It will foster critical thinking, innovation, and problem-solving skills in students, preparing them for a technology-driven future.\nSTEM-related jobs are the engine of India's economic growth, yet many of these jobs are projected to go unfilled due to a gap in skills. The problem is more acute in low and middle-income groups and much more prevalent among girls and women. Today, women constitute a minority in both STEM education and careers, representing only 30 per cent of graduates in engineering and technology fields.\nIn addition to this new STEM initiative with Smile Foundation, the BMW Group has also been working closely with UNICEF to transform the educational landscape in India. Globally, BMW Group has a long-term partnership with UNICEF, under the slogan \"BRIDGE. Educating young people for tomorrow, today.\" The STEM education project was introduced in India in 2024, aiming to benefit 100,000 children in four states. The partnership is providing access to quality STEM education to adolescent girls from Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas and Tribal Ashramshalas, belonging to the most marginalized groups in hard-to-reach rural areas in states of Assam, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.\nBMW India Foundation\nThe BMW India Foundation has been set up with the objective of implementing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs on behalf of BMW Group Entities in India - BMW Group India, BMW India Financial Services and BMW India Leasing. BMW India Foundation continues to carry forward the existing engagements already undertaken by the BMW Group India entities and endeavors to significantly scale them up to achieve the intended benefits. It aims to drive the corporate citizenship agenda forward through long term commitment for the projects and deeper association with implementation partners for more positive impact.\nSmile Foundation\nStarted in 2002, Smile Foundation is an Indian development organization that works with children and their families at the grassroot level to provide access to quality education, primary healthcare and livelihood opportunities. It has over 400 projects, spread over 2,000 villages and slums in 25 states of the country. Smile Foundation's Mission Education project focusses on a child-centric approach, involving communities, and fostering holistic development. The initiative bridges educational gaps and empowers children to become well-rounded, confident individuals. This project serves as a catalyst to spread STEM education in unserved schools across the country apart from other initiatives in the education domain.\nIf you have any queries, please contact:\nBMW Group India\nAbhay Dange, Director, Press and Corporate Affairs\nCell: +91 99104 81013; Email: Abhay.Dange@bmw.in\nRicha Sharma, Business and Finance Communication\nCell: +91 99100 22148; Email: Richa.Sharma@bmw.in\nInternet: www.bmw.in\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/bmwindia\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bmwindia\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/bmwindia\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bmwindia_official\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/bmw-group\n#BMWIndiaFoundation #BMWGroupIndia #STEM #Learning\n(ADVERTORIAL DISCLAIMER: The above press release has been provided by VMPL.

It is revealed that Blake Lively has hired a PR crisis manager with deep government ties as her legal battle with Justin, reports Variety. The actress, who is suing and being counter-sued by her It Ends With Us director and co-star, is quietly working with Nick Shapiro, the CIA\u2019s former deputy chief of staff and senior advisor to former director John Brennan. Justin Baldoni-Blake Lively Controversy: \u2018It Ends With Us\u2019 Director Accuses Ryan Reynolds\u2019 Nicepool of Mocking Him in the MCU Film \u2018Deadpool and Wolverine\u2019 - Deets Inside. \u201cThe litigation team for Ms Lively retained Mr Shapiro to advise on the legal communications strategy for the ongoing sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit occurring in the Southern District of New York\u201d, said a member of the actress\u2019 legal team at Willkie Farr & Gallagher. As per Variety, in December, Lively filed a letter with the California Civil Rights Department in which she claimed that Baldoni sexually harassed her during the film\u2019s production in 2023. The CRD letter, which also included allegations of Baldoni waging a 2024 smear campaign against Lively, became the basis of a New York Times report, kicking off a legal back and forth involving a group of more than a dozen people and companies. \u2018Why, What Have You Heard?\u2019 Ryan Reynolds Makes Subtle Reference to Wife Blake Lively\u2019s Legal Drama With Justin Baldoni on SNL 50th Anniversary Special. On New Year\u2019s Eve, Baldoni and nine other plaintiffs, including his crisis publicist Melissa Nathan, sued the New York Times for USD 250 million for libel. Blake Lively then sued Baldoni and the group for violating federal and California state law \u201cby retaliating against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns\u201d. The director then sued the actress and her husband Ryan Reynolds for $400 million for civil extortion, defamation and other actions. In a related suit, Baldoni\u2019s former publicist Stephanie Jones is suing Baldoni and Nathan for breach of contract among other claims. Jones provided the text messages to Lively\u2019s legal team sometime after parting ways with Abel in August 2024 in a move that raised eyebrows. Lively\u2019s lawyers say they received the text messages via a subpoena to Jones\u2019 PR firm Jonesworks. It remains unclear on what grounds Jones would have been required to turn over correspondence involving former client Baldoni or former employee Abel given that no lawsuit had been filed at the time. In yet another lawsuit, Texas-based digital entrepreneur Jed Wallace filed a multi-million dollar suit against Blake Lively in federal court for defamation. He claims that he has suffered millions of dollars in reputational harm after the actress alleged he unleashed a \u201cdigital army\u201d to malign her back in August.", "summary": "Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively's legal feud escalates as Lively enlists former CIA deputy Nick Shapiro as her crisis manager.

Miller reportedly turned down a trade that would've seen him join a Western Conference contender.\n\nJ.T. Miller is enjoying life as a member of the New York Rangers organization after after being traded to them at the end of January in a deal that saw the Canucks acquire Filip Chytil, prospect Victor Mancini and a first-round pick, but it appears another team was pushing hard for the forward before he landed back in The Big Apple.\n\nJ.T. Miller reportedly turned down trade to Western Conference contender\n\nAccording to Renaud Lavoie of TVA Sports, before J.T. Miller was traded to the New York Rangers, the Vancouver Canucks were in talks with the Colorado Avalanche regarding a deal for the 31-year-old, but he reportedly turned it down.\n\nLavoie added that the New York Rangers were convinced J.T. Miller was going to be dealt to the Colorado Avalanche, but the former Canuck reportedly refused to waive his no-movement clause for the trade that would've seen him land in the Mile High City.\n\nNote: the following quote was translated from French'In their minds, they made the trade because J.T. Miller was coming to Colorado. They were convinced that J.T. Miller would be traded from the Canucks to the Avalanche, and from what I'm told, J.T. raised his hand and said, 'I'm not playing in Denver.'' Lavoie said.\n\nMiller, a native of East Palestine, Ohio, has played quite well since his trade to the Rangers, recording nine points (five goals, four assists) and has an even-rating through eight games entering action on Friday.\n\nIt's safe to say that Miller was dead set on going back to the team that drafted him 15th overall in 2011 and had no interest in playing anywhere else, with his no-movement clause causing trouble for Patrik Allvin, who did the best he could with the return in that trade.\n\nIf J.T. Miller were to approve that trade to the Colorado Avalanche last month, it would be interesting to see what assets Patrik Allvin and the Vancouver Canucks could've got.\n\nA first-round pick would've been ideal, but without the Avalanche having one in 2025, it would've had to be either 2026, which is expected to be a much deeper draft than this year, or 2027.\n\nTo replace Miller down the middle, Allvin could've looked at getting former eighth Casey Mittelstadt, who they may be trying to trade before the deadline next Friday.\n\nPatrik Allvin and the Vancouver Canucks are happy with the return they got, with Filip Chytil slotting into that 2C role, they're excited with what they've got in Victor Mancini and the first-round pick they flipped in a trade with Pittsburgh to get Marcus Pettersson, addressing a big area of need - a top-four defenseman.", "summary": "Former Vancouver Canucks forward J.T.

Drama!\n\nSamantha Fox and Mick Fleetwood host the show (1989)\n\nIt\u2019s now been more than 30 years since this happened, and we\u2019re still puzzled as to exactly who thought that teaming up two completely unrelated non-presenters to front one of Britain\u2019s biggest live TV events was a good idea.\n\nThe excruciating evening was dogged with guest mix-ups, autocue fails and jokes that went down like lead balloons. So all in all, not a great night. That being said, we\u2019re still talking about it almost 40 years later, which has got to count for something, right?\n\nRobbie Williams vs. Liam Gallagher (2000)\n\nThey\u2019d already been swapping endless insults in the press for ages, but things between Robbie Williams and Liam Gallagher came to a head at the Brits in 2000.\n\nOur favourite part of this video is right at the end, when the late Caroline Aherne muses that her \u201cmoney would be on Liam\u201d...\n\nMrs Merton delivers her incredible Brits one-liner (1997)\n\nSpeaking of Caroline Aherne, she was on hand to present Best British Single as her Mrs Merton alter-ego back in 1997, and delivered a truly iconic one-liner.\n\nAfter ribbing presenter Ben Elton, she then declared: \u201cCharlie, wherever you are, can you make yourself known? They\u2019re all asking for you backstage. In the toilets, it\u2019s Charlie, Charlie, Charlie... you\u2019d think they\u2019d have enough to do with being pop stars.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s lovely,\u201d she added. Brilliant stuff. \n\nWait, what is Tony Blair doing at the Brit Awards? (1996)\n\nIn a move that seems more strange with every year that passes, David Bowie chose the then-leader of the opposition Tony Blair to welcome him to the stage, when he was awarded the Outstanding Contribution title in 1996.\n\nCat Deeley declares: \u2018Rock is back!\u2019 (2004)\n\nLargely inspired by the success of The Darkness, Cat Deeley opened the Brits in 2004 with a bold declaration about the return of rock music and how Brits bosses had lifted the alcohol ban in place for the previous few years (hence the champagne bottle).\n\nHowever, the night was hardly a rock-heavy occasion, with performers on the night including 50 Cent, Missy Elliott and... Dido.\n\nLittle Mix make history with their Best British Group win (2021)\n\nAfter 10 years in the industry, Little Mix finally bagged their first win in the Best British Group category, becoming the first ever girl group to achieve the accolade.\n\nCelebrating their win, the band \u2013 two of whom were pregnant at the time \u2013 gave a shout-out to the groups who paved the way for them, including the Spice Girls, All Saints and Girls Aloud. They also paid tribute to former bandmate Jesy Nelson, who had quit Little Mix six months earlier.\n\nAnd speaking of long overdue girl band wins (2009)\n\nWe all know this moment really belonged to the late, great Sarah Harding, who summed up Girls Aloud fans everywhere\u2019s feelings when she declared: \u201cIt\u2019s about time!\u201d\n\nKanye West keeps the Brit Awards censors busy for five minutes (2015)\n\nAt the 2015 Brits, the rapper once known as Kanye West took the opportunity to debut a new track, All Day.\n\nUnfortunately for viewers at home, most of it was muted completely by ITV\u2019s censors due to Ye\u2019s repeated use of the N-word (though the censorship didn\u2019t stop some viewers from complaining regardless).\n\nBut Ye isn\u2019t the only one who forced producers to cut the sound (2020/2021)\n\nIt\u2019s actually become something of an unofficial Brits tradition for the sound to mysteriously cut out every year whenever Lewis Capaldi has something to say on stage.\n\nAccepting his first ever Brit with a Red Stripe in his hand in 2020, censors had to act fast in the middle of Lewis\u2019 acceptance speech, when he declared: \u201cThank you very fucking much.\u201d\n\nThe following year, Lewis returned to the Brits, only for the exact same thing to end up happening.\n\nGeri Halliwell\u2019s dress becomes immediately iconic (1997)\n\nThe legend goes that Geri Halliwell and her sister made her infamous Union Jack dress with a tea-towel, adding a peace sign on the back so as not to offend anyone.\n\nYears later, the iconic garment went on to sell for a record-breaking \u00a341,320 at an auction.\n\nLizzo meets Marvin Humes (2019)\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, sometimes red carpet coverage of the Brit Awards can verge on being a little dry. More often than not, the stars are on their best behaviour, saving their more raucous antics for the infamous after-parties.\n\nSo we were glad when Lizzo made her Brits debut in 2019 (right before her mainstream breakthrough), chatting candidly backstage to Marvin Humes, which ended in the truly iconic line: \u201cFrom his lips to my p***y.\u201d\n\nLizzo and Harry Styles really get into the chaotic swing of things (2020)\n\nYou can always rely on Lizzo to bring the party. \n\nNeither she nor Harry Styles even took home awards in 2020, but they were still the true winners on the night thanks to this chaotic \u2013 and tequila-assisted \u2013 scene.\n\nLittle Mix really felt like celebrating after winning their first ever Brit Award (2017)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to choose a favourite moment of this compilation, just watch and enjoy.\n\nStormzy calls out then-prime minister Theresa May during his performance (2018)\n\nBy the end of the 2018 ceremony, the night already belonged to Stormzy, who had picked up Best British Male as well as the top award of the night, Best British Album.\n\nIt was fitting, then, that he should also close the show, putting on an elaborate performance of Blinded By Your Grace, pt. 2. It was what came next that grabbed headlines, though, as he launched into a freestyle rap calling out Theresa May\u2019s government for their reaction to the Grenfell tragedy, as well as highlighting injustice and institutional racism.\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough, off came the t-shirt and on came the rain, for an energetic run of Big For Your Boots. Incredible stuff, which even won praise from then-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nAnd Stormzy\u2019s not the only one to call out the government at the Brits (2021)\n\nAfter her second Best British Female win in 2021 \u2013 the first Brits to take place after the pandemic \u2013 Dua Lipa announced she\u2019d be sharing her win with nurse Dame Elizabeth Anionwu, the emeritus professor of nursing at the University of West London.\n\nTurning her attention to the many frontline workers in attendance on the night, Dua said: \u201cIt\u2019s all very good to clap for them but we need to pay them.\n\n\u201cI think what we should do is we should all give a massive, massive round of applause and give Boris [Johnson, who was then prime minister] a message that we all support a fair pay rise for our front line.\u201d\n\nJoss Stone raises eyebrows with her comedy routine... and accent (2007)\n\nAdmittedly, Joss Stone had been off the scene for a little while by the time she hit the stage to present Best British Male at the 2007 Brits, but last time we checked, she was from Devon, not the East Coast of America?\n\nThe singer created a stir not just for her accent, but also her \u201ctribute\u201d to Robbie Williams, who she\u2019d performed with years earlier, as well as her joke about Russell Brand\u2019s past rehab stint.\n\nSharon Osbourne vs. Vic Reeves (2008)\n\nShe\u2019d been (surprisingly) on her best behaviour all night, but Sharon Osbourne lost her patience when Vic Reeves struggled with the autocue while presenting the biggest award of the night.\n\nDespite being blasted as a \u201cpisshead\u201d and a \u201cdrunk bastard\u201d, Vic later insisted he hadn\u2019t been drinking.\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough, the Arctic Monkeys went on to hit out at the Brits school in their acceptance speech immediately afterwards, though this was cut from the final broadcast.\n\nPeter Kay vs. Liam Gallagher (2010)\n\nYour dad\u2019s favourite stand-up comedian Peter Kay might seem like an unlikely choice to host the Brits, but he actually wound up being responsible for one of the ceremony\u2019s most rock \u2018n\u2019 roll moments of the 21st century.\n\nWhen Liam Gallagher defiantly threw his Brit into the crowd \u2013 having already snubbed brother Noel in his acceptance speech \u2013 the Phoenix Nights star put him down with a simple \u201cwhat a knobhead\u201d.\n\nNot the wittiest of lines, admittedly, but effective all the same.\n\nJohn Prescott gets a soaking (1998)\n\nProving that politics and pop aren\u2019t always the best companions, when then Labour Cabinet Minister attended the 1998 bash, Tubthumping rock band Chumbawamba thought they\u2019d let him know exactly how they felt about him getting an invite by throwing a bucket of iced water over the MP.\n\nDespite the fact the record label apologised, the band were unrepentant, saying: \u201cIf John Prescott has the nerve to turn up at events like the Brit Awards in a vain attempt to make Labour seem cool and trendy, then he deserves all we can throw at him.\u201d\n\nAlex Turner gets some stuff off his chest (2014)\n\nWhen Arctic Monkeys won Best Album in 2014, frontman Alex Turner left us all baffled with his odd \u201cthat rock and roll, eh?\u201d acceptable speech.\n\nThis ended in him telling Brits bosses, \u201cinvoice me for the microphone,\u201d before dropping it on the floor and walking off.\n\nRock and, indeed, roll.\n\nBelle And Sebastian\u2019s win confuses everyone (1999)\n\nFirst off, underdogs Belle and Sebastian had released a total of three albums when they were announced as the winners of Best British Newcomer in 1999, beating actual newcomers Steps, who had been heavily tipped for the award.\n\nTheir confusing victory led the national press to accuse them of rigging the vote in their favour by encouraging university students to vote online (which was still a fairly radical idea in 1999), though they insisted at the time this was not the case.\n\nBrandon Block vs. Ronnie Wood (2000)\n\nThat same year Robbie took on Liam Gallagher, Ronnie Wood was presenting Best Soundtrack when suddenly he was interrupted by confused DJ (and future Celebrity Big Brother walker) Brandon Block, who had been jokingly informed by his friends that he\u2019d won an award.\n\nAfter Ronnie called him a \u201cc***\u201d for interrupting, the two squared up, drinks were thrown and security were called.\n\nIt was all super awks, to be honest.\n\nThe Brits face a backlash after failing to recognise any women in the Best Artist category (2023)\n\nThe Best British Artist category was introduced in 2022, replacing the gendered Best British Male and Best British Female categories in a move towards inclusivity.\n\nWhile its inaugural outing saw Adele taking home the award, its second year raised eyebrows after not a single woman was nominated.\n\nBrits organisers later issued a statement saying: \u201cWe acknowledge and share in the disappointment that, unlike last year, no women are represented in the [Artist Of The Year] shortlist.\n\n\u201cThere may be a number of reasons for this, but a key factor is that, unfortunately, there were relatively few commercially successful releases by women in 2022 compared to those by men, which means that, of the 71 eligible artists on the longlist, only 12 (17%) are women.\n\n\u201cWe recognise this points to wider issues around the representation of women in music that must also be addressed.\u201d\n\nSadie Pinn crashes Ant and Dec\u2019s presenting spot (2016)\n\nDespite the model\u2019s sudden appearance \u2013 and her eye-catching outfit \u2013 the boys barely broke a sweat. Such pros.\n\nHarry Styles almost misses One Direction\u2019s Global Success Award (2014)\n\nIn 2013, the Brits faced a backlash for the introduction of the Global Success award, which some suggested was just a ploy to give One Direction a prize on the night.\n\nA year later, they won in the same category for a second time, though most of their acceptance speech was conducted as a four-piece, as Harry Styles was preoccupied in the lavatory at the time.\n\nBj\u00f6rk\u2019s acceptance speech is pure Bj\u00f6rk (1998)\n\nAfter being swung around by Alexander McQueen, Best International Female winner Bj\u00f6rk told the crowd: \u201cI am... grate...ful... grape... fruit.\u201d\n\nAndy Bell makes a subtle protest (1989)\n\nAfter Erasure won Best British Group, frontman Andy Bell kissed presenter Boy George on the cheek, a subtle move by today\u2019s standards, but one that he claimed was a deliberate action against Section 28, which had been introduced by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government the previous year.\n\nJack Whitehall reminds us what the Brits should be about (2018)\n\nIn the 2010s, the Brit Awards played it safe with its hosts, which ranged from James Corden to Ant and Dec, finally ending up with Dermot O\u2019Leary and Emma Willis.\n\nWe\u2019ll admit we didn\u2019t exactly have high hopes when Jack Whitehall was announced, but after a decade of chumminess, it was so refreshing to have a host who would poke fun at the famous nominees, while successfully managing not to cross the line into nastiness.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z give props to Meghan Markle (2019) \n\nBey and Jay weren\u2019t even at the Brits in 2019, but they still managed to steal the show completely with this video message, in which they made a subtle show of solidarity with the Duchess of Sussex.\n\nMadonna falls down some stairs and promptly picks herself back up again (2015)\n\nAfter being accidentally pulled down some steps due to a cape-related wardrobe malfunction, the whole nation held its collective breath as Madonna dusted herself off and, in the words of her song Living For Love, \u201cpicked up my crown, put it back on my head\u201d and \u201ccarried on\u201d.\n\nThe 2025 Brit Awards will take place on Saturday 1 March at 8pm on ITV1.", "summary": "Robbie Williams, Madonna, Girls Aloud and Adele have all been at the centre of iconic Brit Awards momentsThe Brit Awards are now widely renowned as being one of the most chaotic awards shows going \u2013 thanks to the on-stage blunders, political statements and jaw-dropping celebrity feuds that have played out during the ceremony over the last 40 years.\n\nAhead of this year\u2019s event, we\u2019ve rounded up the good,\u00a0the bad and, indeed, the ugly for you, and hand-picked 32 of the most memorable Brits\u00a0moments ever.\n\nAll we can say now is, roll on Saturday night\u2019s ceremony...\n\nAdele proves why you don\u2019t rush a superstar (2013)\n\nBest British Album is the category every UK artist wants to win at the Brits, so it\u2019s understandable that Adele would want to soak up the moment when 21 was given the accolade.\n\nSadly for host James Corden, it looked as though her acceptance speech was going to overrun into Blur\u2019s performance back in 2012, so he clumsily stepped in to try and wrap things up.\n\nAs James tried to hurry her along, the fr", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/brit-awards-2025-iconic-outrageous-mometns_uk_67bc86e3e4b0f8f8483aaf21", "image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/67bf2bb618000018007ba5dc.jpg?cache=Kl0uCxm9Ms&ops=1778_1000", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:00:03", "author": "Daniel Welsh", "authors": ["Daniel Welsh"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.229}, {"id": 295540838, "title": "This Trick Turned My American Pancakes From Rubbery Discs To Fluffy Perfection", "text": "I\u2019m pretty fussy about my food.

It could go limp as it bakes otherwise. \n\nSo, following that philosophy, I used to put American pancake batter into a preheated pan the second I finished beating it.\n\nBut as it turns out, that\u2019s not advised in this case. \n\nFlour company King Arthur says that it\u2019s important to let American pancake batter rest for a minimum of five minutes, which \u201callows the leaveners in the batter to be almost fully activated.\u201d \n\nThat should result in the \u201ctallest and lightest pancakes possible,\u201d they say. \n\nThe company adds: \u201cYou\u2019ll know when it\u2019s ready because the batter gives a little jiggle if you tap the mixing bowl, instead of looking thin like water.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ll admit I was nervous trying it for the first time, but it definitely worked \u2015 batter that had been allowed to rest for seven minutes, which is how long it took to achieve the jiggle King Arthur flour described, provided the lightest, tallest, crispiest golden pancakes I\u2019ve ever made. \n\nWhy does resting the batter matter?\n\nAccording to Tasting Table, it gives the batter more time to absorb the flour \u2015 ensuring a smoother and lighter result.\n\nIt\u2019ll also help to release fluff-creating starches and protein from the flour too. \n\nAs for the baking soda I was so worried about, it seems a five-minute rest will actually help to distribute it more evenly throughout the batter \u2015 ensuring far better results. \n\nYup, I\u2019m never going back...", "summary": "Pancake batter with blueberries, uncooked, on the left; fluffy pancakes cooking on the rightI\u2019m pretty fussy about my food.

She and her guests roll up their sleeves in the kitchen, the garden, and beyond, and invite you to do the same.\u201d \n\nJust One Look (5 March)\n\nTell me more: While admittedly Polish mystery dramas aren\u2019t usually top of our list of recommendations to people, it\u2019s worth pointing out that this one is based on a story by Harlan Coben, so if you\u2019re a fan of series like Missing You, The Stranger and Fool Me Once, this could well get you hooked.\n\nLater in the month, another Harlan Coben mystery \u2013 this time Caught, from Argentina \u2013 is also premiering on Netflix.\n\nNetflix says: \u201cWhen an ominous photo mysteriously surfaces, Greta must confront buried truths \u2014 and her hazy memory \u2014 to save her husband from his dark secrets.\u201d\n\nTyler Perry\u2019s Beauty In Black (6 March)\n\nTell me more: Beauty In Black was the first project to come out of movie and TV super-producer Tyler Perry\u2019s multi-million dollar deal with Netflix.\n\nWhile the first half of the soapy and scandalous drama came out last year, this new batch of episodes is now set to complete the season, clearing up some of the mysteries and cliffhangers that left fans on tenterhooks back in October.\n\nNetflix says: \u201cTyler Perry\u2019s smash hit returns to Netflix with higher stakes, more drama, and unthinkable betrayal. Vengeance spares no one.\u201d\n\nPlankton: The Movie (7 March)\n\nTell me more: The second in a series of Spongebob spin-off movies being made by Netflix, this one centres around our hero\u2019s long-time frenemy Plankton.\n\nExcitingly, this one is being billed as a musical comedy, with new songs by Flight Of The Concords\u2019 Bret McKenzie, Grammy winner Linda Perry (behind hits like Christina Aguilera\u2019s Beautiful and Pink\u2019s Get The Party Started) and Marvel composer Mark Mothersbaugh.\n\nNetflix says: \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants\u2019 tiniest frenemy, Sheldon J.

Black, plus-size and newly single (not by her choice!), Mavis unexpectedly finds herself having to rebuild her life as a struggling stylist.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s determined to not only survive but thrive with the support of her chosen family, a body positive attitude, and a cute v-neck with some lip gloss.\u201d\n\nBlue Box (TBA)\n\nTell me more: Based on the popular Japanese manga, Blue Box is going to be a must-watch for anyone who lives anime or just something cosy to stick on before bed.\n\nBlue Box centres around a group of struggling high school athletes doing their most to improve their skills, while embarking on new friendships, and potential romances, along the way.\n\nNetflix says: \u201cA coming-of-age love story revolving around school sports clubs, this series delicately portrays relatable characters who devote themselves wholeheartedly to their club activities, as well as the subtle emotions that arise when they fall for someone.\u201d", "summary": "A selection of Netflix's new originals coming in March 2025Whether you\u2019re in the mood for thrills and twists or something cosy to snuggle up to, there\u2019s plenty to keep you entertained on Netflix this March.\n\nIn the month ahead, fans of comedy, drama, family adventure and even star-studded variety have all got new offerings to tune into on the platform.\n\nHere are just 10 of our top picks coming to the streaming service in the next few weeks...\n\nWith Love, Meghan (4 March)\n\nTell me more: Since the 2022 documentary Harry &amp;

The email shown to CBS News instructed federal workers to \"please reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets describing what you accomplished last week and cc your manager.\"It also indicated that such an edict would continue. \"Going forward, please complete the above task each week by Mondays at 11:59pmET,\" the email read. The Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Energy and the Treasury Department were among the agencies that received it. However, unlike the first such email circulated to the federal workforce last week, it allowed employees who deal with sensitive information to opt out of a full response. \"Please do not send links, attachments, or any classified/sensitive information,\" the email read. \"If all of your activities are classified or sensitive, please write 'All of my activities are sensitive.'\"Earlier Friday, sources familiar with the directive confirmed to CBS News the new email was expected to come from individual federal agencies, not the Office of Personnel Management, as was the case with the emails sent last week. That government-wide directive caused confusion as to whether a response was required \u2014 and the possible ramifications of not answering.With this new round of emails, OPM advised agencies to send the messages themselves, and each department has the discretion to decide whether to do so, sources told CBS News earlier Friday. The emails are part of a strategy to have agencies account for their employees' work each week and report it back to the government's human resources agency, though no decision has been made about whether the messages will go out weekly, the sources said.In addition to the individual agencies deciding whether to send the emails, each will decide how long their workforces have to respond and the consequences of not replying, CBS News learned.Since returning to the White House, President Trump has made reducing the size of the federal government a key part of his second-term agenda. He tasked Elon Musk to lead the cost-cutting effort through the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, though the billionaire is not the administrator of the task force. The White House confirmed earlier this week that Amy Gleason, who worked at the U.S. Digital Service, the precursor to DOGE, is its acting administrator.But Musk and his team have roiled the federal government with their initiative; as thousands of probationary federal workers were fired, DOGE employees have sought access to departments' data systems housing sensitive information and work at some independent agencies has ground to a halt.Their actions have sparked numerous lawsuits, and on Thursday, a federal judge in California found that the mass firings of probationary employees were likely unlawful.The initial round of emails sent to the federal workforce last Saturday came from OPM with the subject line \"What did you do last week?\" It directed recipients to reply with five examples of what they accomplished in the prior week and include their bosses in the response. Government employees had until 11:59 p.m. Monday to answer and were told not to \"send any classified information, links, or attachments.\"Musk had initially warned on social media that a failure to respond \"will be taken as a resignation,\" but several agencies, including the FBI and Departments of State, Homeland Security and Defense, told their employees to ignore the request. OPM then told human resources officials from departments Monday that it was up to each agency to decide how they would handle the emails to their workers.But a memo also sent Monday to agency leaders that sought to provide guidance on the government-wide \"what did you do last week\" email said responses should be directed to department leadership, with a copy going to OPM. It said \"agencies should review responses and evaluate nonresponses.\" The memo did not mention the directions given by department heads that instructed their workforce not to reply.Roughly 1 million federal workers responded to the first \"what did you do last week\" email. Mr. Trump said during a Cabinet meeting Wednesday that those who didn't reply \"are on the bubble\" and said his administration wasn't \"thrilled\" about the non-responses.\"Maybe they're going to be gone, maybe they're not around, maybe they have other jobs,\" the president said.", "summary": "A second email asking government workers to detail what they did in the last week went out to some agencies on Saturday.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/second-what-did-you-do-last-week-goes-out-some-federal-workers/", "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/02/28/222e7d2d-0169-476a-bbd5-7d34f6427706/thumbnail/1200x630g2/ff3309006aa9027389b13149aaf5db4e/gettyimages-2201498883.jpg?v=8de240724d7f6d8b5f54f62bb158c012", "video": "https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3566003_hls/master.m3u8", "publish_date": "2025-03-01 05:05:00", "author": "Jennifer Jacobs,Kristin Brown,Melissa Quinn,Sara Cook", "authors": ["Jennifer Jacobs", "Kristin Brown", "Melissa Quinn", "Sara Cook"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.142}, {"id": 295540684, "title": "Furious bride POSTPONES wedding after blaming husband-to-be for getting her fired", "text": "The 28-year-old blamed her groom for losing her job after she slept in .

On the Timberwolves, Anthony Edwards is the finisher. Nikola Jokic always is trusted to get the Nuggets to the promised land.\n\nSo who is that guy for the Bulls?\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have that,\u201d coach Billy Donovan said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can play like that.\u201d\n\nThe loss to the Clippers on Wednesday was the most recent example since the team traded its leading scorer, Zach LaVine, before the deadline.\n\nThe Bulls are 2-3 in clutch games since LaVine\u2019s departure. Against the Clippers, they closed the deficit to three with less than three minutes to play before the Clippers\u2019 closer, James Harden, did his thing.\n\nHe had 30 points, and his seven in the fourth quarter were nothing special except that they came exactly when they were needed \u2014 in the last three minutes.\n\nThe question for Bulls management and Donovan is: Can they turn somebody already in-house into that type of player?\n\n\u201cCoby [White] \u2014 throughout his career, whether it was through DeMar [DeRozan] or [LaVine] or even [Nikola Vucevic] \u2014 has made big shots in big moments,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cI can refer back to a time where Patrick [Williams has] made big threes when maybe DeMar\u2019s gotten trapped, and it\u2019s gotten sprayed out, and Patrick\u2019s left shooting the basketball.\n\n\u2018\u2018I think at times a lot of these guys have made shots in the moment. What is different for them is now they\u2019re the engine.\u201d\n\nDonovan believes being in close late-game situations will help White, Ayo Dosunmu and Josh Giddey develop that knack. Friday\u2019s win against the Raptors validated Donovan\u2019s theory. But being the closer is not strictly about making the shot.\n\n\u201cThat was the thing that was really good with DeMar,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cHe really had a good balance of understanding, \u2018OK, a double-team is coming, I have the ball in my hands. I have to get off of it.\u2019 I don\u2019t necessarily go into it like, this is the guy. DeMar was great. It was pretty clear-cut.\n\n\u2018\u2018But with some of these guys that are getting into these situations, putting them in there to see how they can respond and see how they can learn and grow is important.\u201d\n\nShut Vooch down?\n\nVucevic missed his third consecutive game Friday with a strained right calf. Before his injury, a decrease in production had become an issue.\n\nThe LaVine trade brought in Zach Collins, who provides much-needed depth in the frontcourt for the Bulls, who have control of the last play-in spot with 23 games left in the regular season.\n\nDonovan said any consideration of sitting Vucevic down for a stretch in favor of getting a better look at the Bulls\u2019 other options in the frontcourt is \u201cabove my head.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other thing I look at, too, is the player,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cVooch has been a guy throughout his career that has prided himself on being available and prides himself on playing at a pretty high level.

A fourth-quarter surge led by Coby White \u2014 including converting a four-point play with six seconds left in regulation \u2014 was enough to force overtime. From there, it was a concerted effort by the Bulls to help them maintain their status as the better of two bad teams with their 125-115 win, giving them a 2.5 game advantage in the race for the final play-in spot. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us, especially all of us as a younger team to get that experience winning,\u201d White said. \u201cTo experience winning and playing in those big time games.\u201d \n\n\u201cWe have guys in here that want to win. So we have to continue to stack and get better.\u201d \n\nJosh Giddey put together a strong first-quarter performance doling out seven assists, helping him earn his another double-double, finishing with 17 points, 12 assists and eight rebounds. Matas Buzelis gave fans a pair of captivating dunks, contributing to his 10 points and Kevin Huerter added 15 points off the bench. \n\nWhite was the difference maker late, finishing with 24 points, including 15 in the fourth quarter and four rebounds. Lonzo Ball added 14 points and eight players scored in double figures. The Raptors frontcourt duo, RJ Barrett and Scottie Barnes and guard Immanuel Quickley deserve much of the credit for maintaining a product worth watching through the first three and a half quarters. \n\nBarrett and Barnes combined for 42 points, while Quickley finished with 23 points before fouling out in overtime. \n\nPride, although an admirable quality, might be the Bulls\u2019 most significant detriment because while there\u2019s value in effort, this team stands to gain nothing with each game they add to the win column. \n\nThe trade for franchise player Zach LaVine did little to put the Bulls in a better position long-term. All they gained was control of their 2025 first-round pick from the Spurs, a pick they never should have lost control of to begin with. This current roster isn\u2019t constructed to win against formidable opponents as proven by their recent slate of games.\n\nSince the Bulls traded LaVine on February 2, Giddey has been the team\u2019s leading scorer, averaging 19.9 points per game. He is set to become a restricted free agent this summer, which would remove any interest in a half-hearted effort. Friday night, White showed the glimmer of a player who can be the Bulls closer in the absence of their former two, LaVine and DeMar Derozan. \n\nStill, the question remains: what does this franchise stand to gain if this train continues on its mediocre path? \n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with players that have, in some cases, a very short window to play,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cA year in basketball is a big deal. You listen to [DeRozan] talk about the fact that he\u2019s got 15 years in the league and doesn\u2019t know where it went. It\u2019s really hard to ask a player or to give the impression to a player or a team that winning is not that important.\u201d \n\nThey don\u2019t have the heart to lose, but they don\u2019t have enough talent to win in a meaningful way, either, leaving them in arguably the worst place a team can be: NBA purgatory. \n\n\u201cDo we have a championship-level team?\u201d Donovan posed to himself. \u201cDo we have one of the best records? No. But there is an opportunity to play after our last regular season game.

Since the adoption of the law on PPP in 2019, Uzbekistan has successfully leveraged private investment to enhance public services.\n\nPPP projects have already yielded positive results. In early childhood education, the private sector has contributed to a 77% coverage rate by opening 1.2mn private kindergarten places. In higher education, 57 projects have provided dormitory housing for 29,000 students. In healthcare, private services have grown in areas such as otolaryngology, diagnostics, and laboratory testing.\n\nDespite these achievements, significant opportunities remain. The government aims to build modern multi-disciplinary clinics in Tashkent, Fergana, Bukhara, Andijan, and Samarkand. Additionally, non-medical services in regional central hospitals will be transferred to private operators to improve efficiency.\n\nThe cultural and sports sectors are also being considered for private investment. So far, 43 cultural centers have been transferred to private management, and authorities have identified 127 more for potential partnerships. To enhance community access to sports, officials proposed a simplified process for private entities to manage facilities such as swimming pools, gyms, and sports grounds.\n\nPresident Mirziyoyev approved roadmaps for ministries and local administrations to implement these projects, instructing officials to accelerate private sector participation in Uzbekistan\u2019s social development.\n\nFollow Daryo's official Instagram and Twitter pages to keep current on world news.", "summary": "Uzbekistan teams up with global partners to implement healthcare and education projects  DARYO.UZ - CENTRAL ASIA & AFGHANISTAN NEWS", "url": "https://daryo.uz/en/2025/03/01/uzbekistan-teams-up-with-global-partners-to-implement-healthcare-and-education-projects", "image": "https://daryo.uz/static/2025/03/medium-67c21b6889ce0.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 04:31:00", "author": "Daryo.uz", "authors": ["Daryo.uz"], "language": "en", "source_country": "uz", "sentiment": 0.337}, {"id": 295550502, "title": "Malta\u2019s\u00a0Imports,\u00a0Exports\u00a0Set To\u00a0Expand\u00a0By 5%\u00a0Annually", "text": "Reading Time: 2 minutes\n\nMalta\u2019s economy continues to show resilience amid global challenges or the transport and logistics sector with imports and exports expected to expand by around 5% annually.\n\nAddressing the Association of the Tractor and Trailer Operators (ATTO)\u2019s first international conference earlier this week, Malcolm Bray, Head of Bank of Valletta\u2019s Economic Unit provided an economic outlook highlighting Malta\u2019s resilience in a shifting global landscape.\n\nBray noted that while major European economies like France and Germany are experiencing slow growth, Malta continued to record elevated real GDP growth in 2024, estimated at 5%, with a steady 4% annual growth projected in the medium term.

Teams do a full grand prix distance so the level of fuel is known, even if other settings, such as engine modes, may still not be comparable from car to car.\n\nOn the afternoon of the second day of testing, McLaren's Lando Norris did a race-simulation run at the same time as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The Briton's pace was breathtaking.\n\nHe would have won the 'race' by more than 30 seconds, and was on average more than 0.5secs a lap quicker than his rivals.\n\nLeclerc would have finished about two seconds ahead of Antonelli.\n\nOn the final afternoon, Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell were out at the same time doing the same thing.\n\nAgain, the McLaren was faster, although not by as much. Piastri was an average of 0.2secs a lap quicker than Russell. That would mean winning by just over 10 seconds.\n\nHowever, Piastri's advantage was nearly all gained in the first stint, in which he was 0.5secs quicker than Russell. In the second and third stints, the McLaren's advantage was just 0.05secs.\n\nIt's pointless comparing the times of Norris, Leclerc and Antonelli with those of Piastri, Russell from one day to the next, because Thursday was cooler and less windy than Friday. \n\nF1 cars are faster in cooler conditions because the higher air density increases both downforce and engine performance, and wind is bad news for the cars' sensitive aerodynamics.\n\nOver one lap, the McLaren's pace was less outstanding - but then it's harder to tell that in testing. For what it's worth, McLaren seem pretty level-pegging over a single lap with Ferrari, a Verstappen-driven Red Bull and Mercedes.\n\nMcLaren were keen to play down any claims that they were ahead.\n\nTeam principal Andrea Stella said he \"would be very careful\" about drawing conclusions from Norris' run, suggesting the usually cool conditions in Bahrain \"were in a sweet spot for our car - they were conditions our car enjoys, cool, not much wind\".\n\nStella's point is that the conditions perhaps masked some of the weaknesses McLaren have had in Bahrain in recent years - the track's combination of mainly slow corners and traction-dominated layout do not play to the car's strengths, especially in the heat that is normally typical in the desert.\n\nBut there is another way of looking at that. If McLaren can be this quick on a circuit that does not suit their car, just how good could they be at Melbourne, which on paper is much more their kind of track?\n\nThe McLaren excels in the sort of medium-speed corners and low-grip surface that are typical at Albert Park, where front-end performance is the main limitation for an F1 car, not rear as in Bahrain.\n\nNorris, sitting in a news conference with Verstappen and Leclerc, said: \"If we want to improve anything at the moment, it's the rear, but the rest of it feels correct and feels in the same ball park.\n\n\"I don't think we are expecting to be a big step ahead of everyone. We are expecting to be close to the guys to my right.

Paddy can punch, no doubt he can punch. \n\n\"But Andy saying he punches\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009they believe he punches harder than Crocker and that half worries me because it makes me feel like they\u2019re going to stand in front of him and they\u2019re going to try and fight him.\n\n\u201cFor Paddy, that worries me, because Andy might be saying that, but Adam Booth said to me that Crocker was the biggest puncher, pound for pound, that he\u2019s ever took on the pads.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s took David Haye, he\u2019s took George Groves, he\u2019s took Andy Lee \u2014 and he\u2019s saying Crocker is the biggest puncher.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going, \u2018Holy God, that guy must punch if he\u2019s saying pound-for-pound he punches harder than these guys\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting fight. I believe Lewis late but anything can happen.\n\n\u201cYou flip back and forth and you can see different scenarios and you know why both guys can win.\n\n\u201cBut something for me leans towards Lewis by a late stoppage.\n\n\u201cIf Paddy thinks, and this what I\u2019ve heard, they\u2019re going to stand in front of him? I don\u2019t know how long it lasts.\n\n\u201cLewis can take a punch, we haven\u2019t seen Paddy hit by a big proper welterweight yet \u2014 and Lewis hits like a heavyweight.\n\n\u201cBut how hard can Paddy hit Lewis, to hurt Lewis? He hits very hard, he hits very sharp, his body punching is fantastic. He\u2019s probably the better technical boxer.\n\n\u201cThis is what baffles me about Lewis \u2014 because Lewis can box. He has skill. \n\n\"But the guy loves to hurt people, to go to war, hit them hard and often. He loves hurting people.\n\n\u201cThey can play that against him where they\u2019re making him throw and counter. Or he could just break him.\u201d\n\nThe bookies cannot split them and have given the same odds for both men.\n\nSunSport has it 51:49 to Donovan \u2014 possibly getting the edge due to his sheer accuracy \u2014 but it is that close.\n\nConlan added: \u201cI know the punch you\u2019re talking about \u2014 the back hand to the body \u2014 I know the exact one, because he\u2019s landed it on a couple of people and he lands it well.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good fighter, a great fighter, with a great boxing brain.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s whether or not he\u2019ll be willing to take the risk of what\u2019s coming back.\n\n\u201cBut something tells me that Lewis will break him down.\u201d\n\nOTHER ACTION\n\nThe battle of local pals Tommy McCarthy and Stephen Ward offers firm support on the undercard.\n\nHome hero P\u00e1draig McCrory will take on England\u2019s Craig Richards over ten rounds at light-heavyweight.\n\nOlympian Kurt Walker faces a testing tussle with Leon Woodstock.\n\nTipp title hopeful Shauna Browne has been parachuted in for a collision with fellow unbeaten ace Elif Nur Turhan of Turkey.\n\nAnd there is another all-Irish derby in the form of the Ruadhan Farrell v Gerard Hughes rematch.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.thesun.ie/sport/14801304/paddy-donovan-lewis-crocker-fight-odds-michael-conlan/", "image": "https://www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/crop-14801308.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:54:56", "author": "Kevin Byrne,Vincent Whelan", "authors": ["Kevin Byrne", "Vincent Whelan"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.042}, {"id": 295550084, "title": "Stephen Bradley dismisses Ian Harte\u2019s \u2018crazy\u2019 claim about League of Ireland clubs killing dreams of young players", "text": "STEPHEN BRADLEY has joined Stephen Kenny in slamming Ian Harte for his claim that League of Ireland clubs were \u2018killing lads\u2019 chances\u2019 by \u2018blocking dream moves\u2019.\n\nThe former Ireland international turned agent was branded an \u2018empty vessel\u2019 by St Pat\u2019s boss Kenny for his comments on a betting blog.\n\nShelbourne supremo Damien Duff added: \u201cI don\u2019t like agents. I never have. I\u2019d die for my players, I\u2019m not sure how many agents would die for their players.\u201d\n\nAnd Shamrock Rovers counterpart Bradley \u2013 who denied Harte\u2019s claim that Justin Ferizaj, now with Italian side Frosinone, had been priced out of a move to the English Premier League \u2013 chipped in too.\n\nBradley said: \u201cSometimes something comes out in the media that doesn\u2019t even warrant a response. I don\u2019t know what to say to it. It\u2019s incredible.\n\n\u201cMaybe the clubs should get together and we all agree, I\u2019ll speak to Damien and see can we agree to let our players go for free, maybe.\n\n\"We\u2019ll all agree to that, try to keep him happy. You are wasting your time responding to that, really.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s grabbed a few headlines, but I don\u2019t think there is one person around who agreed with one point in the whole article. Crazy stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we have shifted away from it, to be honest. I think as a country we have, and we need to keep going that way.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s really hard to give a measured response, or any type of response, to that article, because it is so wrong. Every fact in it was wrong. \n\n\"I\u2019m not too sure what it was about, other than to try and grab a headline, which it obviously did. But it was madness.\u201d\n\nFerizaj broke through at Rovers in the 2022 campaign, at the end of which he spent time on trial at Tottenham. \n\nHe featured for the Hoops early in the 2023 season but then fell out of favour before joining Frosinone in August of that year. The 20-year-old has yet to feature for their first team.\n\nBradley insisted no move to England had been blocked for the ex-Ireland under-19 international, who is also eligible for Albania.\n\nHe said: \u201cNo. Never ever happened. Incredible. Like I said, every fact in it was completely false. I\u2019m not too sure where he got his info.\n\n\u201cWe are past that, I think, as a league. The fans know it, we know it, you know it, the teams in England know it. \n\n\"We are past that. That was probably here, I don\u2019t know how long ago, but it\u2019s not anymore.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about people\u2019s opinions. Everyone has an opinion. You are allowed an opinion. \n\n\"But you don\u2019t have to listen to it. Especially when it\u2019s like that.\n\n\u201cIf there is some merit in it, some facts that you thought, \u2018that\u2019s interesting\u2019, you have the conversation. \n\n\"But we have got to focus on what we are doing, and what we are doing is really good.\n\n\u201cWe need to make it better, of course, we all know what we can do to make it better, we\u2019ve been crying out for it and we need to keep banging the drum.\n\n\u201cBut we are definitely on the right direction. There are also a lot of ex-internationals who are supportive of the league.\n\n\"You can\u2019t forget that. Don\u2019t get sucked into the negative narrative.\u201d\n\nBIGGER PICTURE\n\nBradley highlighted how the lack of urgency when it comes to state funding for academies was a bigger issue.\n\nOn Thursday, Minister Patrick O\u2019Donovan suggested questions on the issue should be posed in a year\u2019s time despite the issue being in the programme for government.\n\nBradley \u2013 who has fielded teenagers such as Michael Noonan, Victor Ozhianvuna and Cory O\u2019Sullivan already this season - said: \u201cThat\u2019s something we need to really push for and not let that be pushed out another year.\n\n\u201cIt is so important for our academies that we have investment.\n\n\u201cThat is something we need to keep banging the drum about and keep talking to the right people and doing the right things.\n\n\u201cThat is something that will help us grow the industry in this country and help bring more Michaels and Victors and Cory O\u2019Sullivan, and the likes of those through.\n\n\u201cWe have got to keep having open dialogue with these people, the decision-makers, and let them see how important it is for us to have that investment for this league; for every club and academy to have it, because that is our future.\n\n\u201cFootball has changed, the landscape has changed, we have all seen that over the last 10 or 15 years, and obviously now with Brexit it has changed again. For the better, I feel, for this country.\n\n\u201cBut we have got to take ownership of that. I feel what we offer here to young players is really, really good. \n\n\"We offer them a chance to develop in a real-life situation, not underage football.\n\nAnd that is so important for players\u2019 development, both as players and as people. \n\n\"That is something we can\u2019t allow to be pushed down the road.\u201d", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.thesun.ie/sport/14801281/stephen-bradley-ian-harte-league-of-ireland-clubs/", "image": "https://www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/crop-14801289.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:20:03", "author": "Neil O'riordan", "authors": ["Neil O'riordan"], "language": "en", "category": "sports", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.218}, {"id": 295550080, "title": "How privacy fence tree blamed for MURDER has become the \u2018must-have\u2019 for your outside space this year", "text": "THINK of a conifer, and the first thing that comes to your mind is probably a massive Leylandii looming over your garden.\n\nAfter their popularity soared in the 1970s - as the desire for privacy and hedging grew - they\u2019ve floundered somewhat since.\n\nCentre to thousands of neighbour disputes - they\u2019ve even been blamed in murder cases.\n\nIn 2003 a leylandii hedge led to the death of two men.\n\nRobert Dickenson, 52, was arrested after allegedly shooting dead his neighbour, 66-year-old George Wilson.\n\nThey'd argued about a privet hedge and also said to have fallen out over a taller section of hedge at the bottom of Mr Dickenson's garden and a 15ft leylandii tree, which was thought to have been the latest bone of contention.\n\nDickenson was found hanged in prison where he was waiting to appear in court on a murder charge.\n\nBecause leylandii can grow 2-3 feet a year, they can also be costly to maintain.\n\nBut happily, there\u2019s a whole range of conifers now you may never have considered.\n\nAnd they can all bring colour, structure and joy to your outside space.\n\nBBC Gardeners Question Time panelist Matthew Pottage, who\u2019s now head of horticulture and landscape strategy at the Royal Parks, told Sun Gardening: \u201cThe bad taste left in many people's mouths is perhaps the mislabelling and misinformation on eventual heights, and growth rates.\n\n\u201cMany slow growing conifers were labelled as dwarf conifers, when in fact they were actually small trees, so ended up causing neighbourly disputes, and inconvenient \u2018blobs\u2019 in the garden landscape.\n\n\u201cBut when positioned right, conifers are a celebration of colour, texture and add important \u2018bones\u2019 to a garden.

The report stated that a closer look at savings trends reveals that the biggest concern lies in household financial savings, which have been declining sharply due to a surge in financial liabilities, primarily unsecured personal loans.It said, A high savings rate is necessary given low FDI rates. A deep dive into savings illustrates that the culprit is financial savings (as opposed to physical savings), and the reason is rise in financial liabilities, chiefly led by rising (unsecured) personal loans .The report highlighted that while India's overall savings rate appears stable, household savings-the largest contributor-have been falling over the years. The data in the report pointed out that in FY00 (Year 2000), household savings accounted for 84 per cent of the total savings in the economy, but this share has now dropped to just 61 per cent in FY23. A major reason for this decline mentioned by the report is the drop in household financial savings, which fell from 10.1 per cent of GDP in FY00 (Year 2000) to just 5 per cent in FY23. At the same time, financial liabilities have risen sharply from 2 per cent to 5.8 per cent of GDP over the same period.A significant portion of household debt is now non-housing debt, which is higher in India compared to many other economies. The report added that this rise in debt is largely driven by a sharp increase in consumer loans. According to the report, the share of consumer loans in total credit has surged from 21 per cent in FY16 to 34 per cent in FY24. In contrast, the share of industry loans has declined from 42 per cent in FY16 to 34 per cent in FY24.One of the key reasons behind this growing indebtedness is the rise of Small Ticket Personal Loans (STPL), which are mostly unsecured and easy to obtain. The report noted that non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), including fintech firms, have become the primary source of these loans, often disbursing them digitally. Unlike traditional banks, these lenders offer quick access to credit, making borrowing easier but also increasing household financial liabilities.The findings raise concerns about the sustainability of India's savings and debt levels. With a higher proportion of income going toward repaying loans, household savings could continue to shrink, potentially affecting long-term economic stability.", "summary": "India's savings rate is not as robust as needed due to declining household financial savings and increasing financial liabilities, especially unsecured personal loans. Household savings have dropped significantly from 84% of total savings in 2000 to 61% in 2023.

Both public and government investment showed growth compared to the previous year, which helped support overall investment levels.It added both public and Government investment exhibited growth in FY24 as compared to FY23. Even, public sector investment reached to an all-time high level For FY25, the report estimates that both savings and investment in the economy will improve, reaching 31 per cent and 32 per cent of GDP, respectively. This positive outlook is supported by expectations of 6.5 per cent GDP growth for FY25.Based on this FY25 GDP growth estimate, the report derives a Q4 GDP growth rate of 7.6 per cent. However, it also mentions that there could be a revision in the quarterly GDP figures in May 2025.The report further notes that India's real GDP growth rate for FY24 is estimated at 9.2 per cent, making it the highest in the past 12 years, except for FY22, when GDP grew 9.7 per cent, the highest since India's independence.The report highlighted the importance of reviving private investment, especially in the corporate sector, to sustain high economic growth in the coming years.", "summary": "The State Bank of India forecasts that a revival in private investment will be key to future economic growth in India.

Nowadays Gary\u2019s ditched the garage and moved into Tileyard North, a converted 18th century mill in the city centre where he makes his organic gin, vodka from prime Yorkshire wheat and rum which is Bonsucro certified, meaning its sugarcane base is sourced responsibly. Alongside wife Victoria, he\u2019s also opened up the cool Distillery Bar right next door.\n\nDuring a two-night trip to Wakefield, which lies a stone\u2019s throw from Leeds, my mate Vanessa and I swung by the Forged Gin School, where Gary coached us into producing our very own bottles of our favourite tipple. Forged\u2019s own gin bottles are particularly eye-catching. Elaborately art-deco in style, they\u2019re designed to capture Wakefield\u2019s mining, textiles and manufacturing heritage \u2013 with tiny intricate label designs including a hammer, anvil and coal.\n\nFor our own gin Gary encouraged us to smell and taste different botanicals and pick up to eight to add to the standard juniper, which every gin must contain, and the coriander and root he recommended. Then we distilled our selection in a neutral grain spirit in individual 2.4 litre copper stills before bottling it up for home. Mine included almond and apricot while Vanessa opted for grapefruit and rose \u2013 but we\u2019ll have to wait a month before trying to allow the botanicals to fully bed in.\n\n As a fascinating insight into the skill and thought behind every bottle it was top notch. (Gin School \u00a395pp, forgedspirits.com )\n\nWakefield is a fantastic short break destination with plenty to do. Once a bustling centre for coal mining and textiles, today the West Yorkshire city sees cobbled streets and reclaimed factory buildings rubbing shoulders with stunning modern architecture.\n\nOur base for two nights was Waterton Park Hotel, based in nearby Walton village on a sprawling country house estate with an illustrious history. Intriguingly there are two hotel buildings \u2013 Walton Hall, a stunning Georgian mansion situated on its own island amid a lake, and a modern alternative.\n\nIn the early 1800s the Hall\u2019s former resident was Charles Waterton, a forward-thinking naturist who campaigned to preserve wildlife habitats in the face of the industrial revolution. He turned his home into a natural history museum and surrounded the ancestral estate with a 9ft wall to keep wildlife in and poachers out, creating the world\u2019s first nature reserve.\n\nOur huge deluxe twin room in the modern part was grand with two double oak-framed beds and a sleek claret velvet sofa. In the new Grand Caf\u00e9, breakfast had mains like smoked salmon and scrambled egg alongside a self-serve buffet while an evening meal of miso glazed sea bass and braised beef shin kept up the decadent feel.\n\nStrolling over a foot bridge to the old Hall, we were also treated to a taste of the serenity that Waterton nurtured during a twilight session in the hotel spa. Wakefield is carving itself out to be the UK\u2019s sculpture capital. World renowned sculptors Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore were both born there and the city is naturally keen to shout about it.\n\n The striking Hepworth Wakefield, opened in 2011, shows off some of their most mesmerising works alongside those of other modern artists. (\u00a314, hepworthwakefield.org )\n\nBut the real cracker for us was the Yorkshire Sculpture Park. The largest in Europe, it\u2019s an Aladdin\u2019s Cave of art with around 90 works dotted around the 500-acre Bretton Hall estate. Memorable bits for us included Damien Hirst\u2019s 33ft tall statue of a pregnant woman and a multi-coloured Buddha by fashion-model-turned artist Niki de Saint Phalle. (from \u00a39.50, ysp.org.uk)\n\n Later we visited Blacker Hall Farm shop to ogle freshly-made pies and cakes and home-reared meat. The huge cookies, brownies laden with Rolos and its renowned pulled pork sandwiches were seriously good. ( blackerhallfarmshop.co.uk ) \n\nNow is a great time to sample Wakefield\u2019s cultural and culinary side too with the opening just last month of a new venue called Wakefield Exchange, or WX for short. As well as hosting events, exhibitions, talks and live music, it\u2019s home to a caf\u00e9, bar and Mexican restaurant.\n\nWe\u2019d arrived in the city via a smooth and stress-free two-hour LNER service from London, which runs every half an hour. If you fancy upgrading to first class you\u2019ll tuck into complimentary brunch bacon rolls from Taste Tradition rare breed specialists, one of the many small local suppliers LNER use along their routes.\n\n Once we arrived Wakefield Museum proved to be a solid starting point, outlining its progress from a booming wool trade centre. (free entry, wakefield.gov.uk ) Last up on our trip was the National Coal Mining Museum in nearby Overton. The centrepiece is a tour of an old mine, led by a former miner. \n\nAfter donning hard hats and offloading our phones to eliminate fire risks we journeyed 460ft underground in one of the original lift shafts that workers themselves used.\n\n It gave us an eerie taste of the dark and cramped conditions miners once suffered. (entry free, underground tours \u00a37.50pp, ncm.org.uk ) \n\nBook the holiday\n\n LNER offers one-way fares from London King\u2019s Cross to Wakefield Westgate starting at \u00a323.60 standard, \u00a358.60 first class. lner.co.uk Direct trains also run from cities including Leeds, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Plymouth, Bristol, Newcastle and Sheffield.

British singer Charli XCX could never have dreamt that her latest album would generate such global hype, but as music journalist Michael Cragg tells us, \u201cShe\u2019s now one of the UK\u2019s biggest exports, and the Brat craze captured people\u2019s imaginations in a way we hardly ever see nowadays.\u201d\n\nBrat was said to be a rejection of the \u201cclean girl\u201d aesthetic, with Charli herself explaining, \u201cIt can be like, so trashy. Just like a pack of cigs and a Bic lighter. And like, a strappy white top with no bra.\u201d It went even further than that, and as music business writer Rhian Jones says, \u201cThe marketing around Brat was so smart that people interpreted it however they wanted to.\u201d\n\n It was symbolised by a shade of slime green, which during summer 2024 was all the rage in everything from fashion to hair and makeup, and even home decor. \u201cThe colour was a way of rejecting the status quo and turning everything upside down,\u201d adds Rhian. \u201cCharli has always done her own thing and doesn\u2019t care if some people see her as a bit weird. She just pushes ahead with self-confidence and determination.\u201d \n\nThough the Brat effect seemed to transform Charli, 32, into a household name almost overnight, she had in fact been in the music industry for 15 years. She was born Charlotte Emma Aitchison in Cambridge to a Scottish father and Indian mother, who she persuaded to loan her money aged 14 so she could begin recording songs.\n\n\u201cI always felt like a loser,\u201d she later said. \u201cI had friends, but my school was full of blonde white girls and I was this half-Indian girl with frizzy hair and different interests. That always made me feel a little bit rejected. I thought if I made music, people would think I was interesting.\u201d\n\nAfter posting her music to MySpace, she was spotted by a club promoter and began DJing at illegal raves in London \u2013 which her parents would drive her to. \u201cMy dad was really into it,\u201d she recalled. \u201cWe arrived at, like, 9pm and they just stood at the back of the sweatbox with all the hipsters.\u201d\n\nCharli, who signed her first record deal with Asylum Records when she was 16, released a string of singles and mixtapes, and in 2012 collaborated with Icona Pop on I Love It, her first UK No1. Her debut album True Romance arrived in April 2013, but peaked at a lowly number 85. Her second album Sucker was recorded in Sweden and more successful upon release in late 2014, with the single Boom Clap reaching No6 in the UK and featuring on The Fault In Our Stars soundtrack.\n\n Describing the album as more \u201cpop-oriented\u201d, she said she \u201cwanted to write an album that I would\u2019ve been obsessed with when I was 14\u201d. As her profile grew, she jumped at the chance to support Taylor Swift on her Reputation Stadium Tour in May 2018, alongside Camila Cabello. \u201cIt was fun to perform Shake It Off with her and Camila every night, and learn how to move across the stage like an actual pop star,\u201d she enthused.\n\nThree further albums followed, beginning in September 2019 with Charli, which featured collaborations with Lizzo, Christine and the Queens, and Haim. Then came How I\u2019m Feeling Now in May 2020, which Charli wrote in six weeks during the pandemic. In March 2022 she released Crash, which aimed to challenge what she called the \u201cvanilla palatable flatness\u201d of pop music. The tactic worked, as it was her first album to reach No1 in the UK.\n\n \u201cThe pop world was quite homogenised before, and it was all sounding quite similar,\u201d says Michael. \u201cEveryone seemed afraid to say much, but Charli came along and made things more fun \u2013 and a bit chaotic.\u201d However, prior to the release of Crash, she revealed on social media that she was struggling behind the scenes. \u201cI\u2019ve been grappling quite a lot with my mental health the past few months and obviously it makes negativity and criticism harder to handle when I come across it,\u201d she posted. \n\nShe added that she would step away from the platform for a while, as \u201cI can\u2019t really handle it here right now\u201d. A few months later, she not only co-headlined Coachella in the US, but also contributed to the Barbie soundtrack with Speed Drive, which became her sixth UK top 10 single. And when Brat finally arrived in June 2024, it debuted at No2 in the UK album chart and produced a raft of hits like Von Dutch, 360 and Apple, which prompted its own viral dance.\n\nAs the #bratsummer trend exploded, millions of videos were posted on TikTok and it was even used by Kamala Harris during her presidential campaign. Reflecting on the movement, Charli told Zane Lowe on Apple Music that \u201ca kind of a monoculture moment happened, which we don\u2019t see a lot of in this day and age\u201d. Though she described the album as her \u201cmost aggressive and confrontational\u201d, she also called it her most vulnerable, and its personal topics included motherhood, relationships and self-identity.\n\n\u201cWhile a party album, it\u2019s also incredibly reflective and messy, and shows how relationships with friends or partners can be complex and difficult,\u201d Michael says. Bratmania shot off the scale when deluxe and remix editions of the album landed, bringing collaborations with big-name artists including Robyn, Troye Sivan, Kesha and Bon Iver, as well as Billie Eilish, who featured on the No1 hit Guess.\n\nAriana Grande guested on Sympathy Is A Knife, while singer Lorde also made an appearance on the Girl, So Confusing reboot, which was widely seen as confirmation that the pair had resolved a rumoured rift. While promoting Brat last June, Charli played an epic Glastonbury set, but it\u2019s fair to say her popularity had far outgrown the 7,000-capacity Silver Hayes field. \n\n\u201cShe will almost certainly be a headliner next time she\u2019s invited back,\u201d says Michael. \u201cIt\u2019s great that she has taken off in this way, six albums into a career that wasn\u2019t always mainstream.\u201d One of Charli\u2019s secret weapons in the making of Brat appears to have been her fianc\u00e9 George Daniel, drummer with The 1975. After they collaborated on the song Spinning in 2021, he was heavily involved as a producer on her latest record.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny, I have never been in a relationship with someone that I\u2019ve worked with, so it\u2019s like a whole new dynamic. But it\u2019s cool,\u201d she has said. They confirmed news of their engagement in November 2023, and speaking about their wedding plans on The Howard Stern Show in October, Charli told how they were \u201cplanning it slowly\u201d. She added, \u201cWe just want to be together forever and have a party with our friends, is our vibe.\u201d\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads", "summary": "The huge Brit export famously coined the term Brat Summer, but as hitmaker Charli XCX admits, she could never have dreamt that she'd go from illegal raves to global superstar", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/inside-charli-xcxs-shocking-past-34664634", "image": "https://i2-prod.ok.co.uk/incoming/article34677981.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MIRROR-Charli.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 07:00:00", "author": "Anna Pointer,Shelley Spadoni", "authors": ["Anna Pointer", "Shelley Spadoni"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.093}, {"id": 295550892, "title": "'I was romantically linked to Princess Diana \u2013 here's my side of the story'", "text": "Will Carling was known as the bad boy of English rugby for many years before he was sensationally rumoured to be having an affair with Princess Diana.\n\nCarling was known for many things throughout his time with the Red Roses between 1988 and 1996. The Harlequins ace was a lion on the field for club and country, but an equally unpredictable individual away from the sport.\n\nWhether it was pinning members of the RFU \"up against the wall\" or inspiring England to reach the 1991 World Cup final, he was never far away from the back pages. However, he became a regular occupant of the feared front pages of the British press when he was rumoured to be in a relationship with Princess Diana while she was still married to then-Prince Charles. \n\nLife became difficult for Carling, who was the son of a Lieutenant Colonel in the Royal Regiment of Wales, when the stories first started appearing in black and white. Looking back on the articles, Carling has been happy to tell his version of events in years gone by.\n\nBack in 2004, when asked if the rumours about a romantic connection with the late 'Queen of People's Hearts' was true by the Sunday Mirror, he firmly replied: \"No, no, no \u2013 how many times do I have to say it? We were friends...\" \n\nResponding to the media fallout as a result of the rumours in another interview with The Telegraph, he added: \"Front page is very different from back page. Yeah, it was not nice.\n\n\"Hey, a lot of that is my own fault, you can\u2019t complain. You have to learn. Relationships that I got wrong... so, that\u2019s what they got fascinated by. You look back on it and you think it was all blown out of all proportion, but it made a good story.\u201d\n\nHis alleged intimacy with the Princess may have entrenched himself into the headlines at first, but his other relationships kept him in the media limelight too. Carling was slammed for leaving his partner Ali Cockayne to move in with Lisa Cooke, who was the wife of his team-mate and Harlequins' longest serving captain David Cooke.\n\nExplaining what happened in 2004, he said: \"I have to admit that I didn't handle things very well, not very well at all. But there are two sides to every story, and no one has heard mine. That's my choice, and I live with it.\"\n\nWhile he went on to have two children with Cooke, he also left his then one-year-old son Henry when he split from Cockayne. At the time, he said: \"It was just one of those things... but there are plenty of reasons that go into the breakdown of a relationship, none of which I am going to discuss in public.\n\n\"One person is more important than anyone else in all of this \u2013 and it's Henry. The day will come when he will have to know what happened between me and his mum, and when the time is right I will sit down and explain things to him, father to son. That's my responsibility. I wouldn't want him hearing it second-hand from someone else.\"\n\nWhile there were a lot of controversies, there were many high points during his time as the leader of the Red Roses. When he was handed the captaincy in 1988 age 22, he was the youngest ever player to be granted the honour. Over the course of 72 caps, he was captain on 59 occasions.\n\n During his rein, England won the Five Nations Grand Slam on three occasions (1991, 1992 and 1995) and also reached the 1991 World Cup final, which saw Australia overcome England 12-6.", "summary": "Princess Diana was never out of the media spotlight, and it was no surprise when former England rugby captain Will Carling was rumoured to be seeing her that it hit the front pages", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/england-princess-diana-rugby-union-34754142", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article4133822.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Prince-Harry-30th.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:00:00", "author": "Patrick Austen-Hardy", "authors": ["Patrick Austen-Hardy"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.325}, {"id": 295550894, "title": "Soap star Nikki Sanderson makes \u2018incredibly difficult decision\u2019 with famous boyfriend", "text": "Rumours have been swirling that actress Nikki Sanderson is preparing to leave Hollyoaks after more than a decade playing resilient but troubled Maxine Minniver. The decision to walk away was an \u201cincredibly difficult\u201d one, as she confirms the news for the first time in this exclusive photoshoot and interview. But a combination of turning 40, having the support of actor boyfriend Anthony Quinlan, 39, and a decade spent delivering some of the soap\u2019s most harrowing scenes, all helped her decide it was the right time.\n\nAnd while she made the leap without a new job lined up, Blackpool-born Nikki reveals she would be open to jumping the soap ship and wouldn\u2019t totally rule out a return to the cobbles of Corrie. \u201cDeciding to leave was an incredibly difficult decision for me because Maxine is a huge, huge part of my life \u2013 and a part of my life that I\u2019ve loved,\u201d she tells us. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to think, \u2018It\u2019s time\u2019, and it wasn\u2019t an instant or overnight decision, it took me a long time to make it and it was something I genuinely fought with myself about, but I\u2019m lucky that I could talk to people around me and get people\u2019s opinions. \u201cI\u2019m grateful that I\u2019ve had the stability for so long, now I\u2019ve just got to embrace the instability of not knowing what\u2019s next.\u201d\n\nAnother contributing factor, she says, was turning 40 last year. While she had no fear of getting older \u2013 and actually thinks this is going to be her best decade yet \u2013 the milestone triggered some self reflection.\n\n\u201cIt feels like yesterday that I turned 21, but it also feels like it was 222 years ago,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cI know I\u2019m older, and time is going fast, but I want to embrace it and be excited about my forties. I\u2019m more confident and comfortable in myself than I used to be, and I want to make the most of whatever exciting things might come my way.\u201d\n\nOne of her current favourite \u201cthings\u201d is her boyfriend of three-and-a-half years, Hollyoaks alumni Anthony who played Gilly Roach from 2005 to 2011. The couple, who live together in the North West, confirmed their romance in 2022 but keep their relationship largely private.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to talk too much about my personal life, but I will say I\u2019m the happiest I\u2019ve ever been, Anthony is incredible\u201d she grins, when we ask about whether they\u2019ve talked about marriage or babies. \u201cI\u2019m in a wonderful, happy relationship, so let\u2019s see what the future holds! Anthony really is my rock, he\u2019s been incredibly supportive of me in my tough decision to leave Hollyoaks.\u201d\n\nHaving a fellow actor as a partner has also helped boost her confidence and lessen her worries about navigating what\u2019s to come in terms of work. \u201cHe\u2019s also been through similar experiences and can fully understand the emotions you go through when it comes to making huge life decisions like this,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s also been in the same position as me in the past, deciding whether it\u2019s the right time or not to leave a role. He knows it\u2019s never an easy decision to make, which is why I\u2019m thankful I\u2019ve had his advice and support throughout it all. I know it\u2019s corny to say but I\u2019m very lucky that I\u2019ve got a lot of people in my life that genuinely care about me and my life decisions, and Anthony is one of those people.\u201d\n\nNikki made her first appearance on the Channel 4 soap as Maxine in November 2012, aged 28, after becoming a household name playing hairstylist Candice Stowe on Coronation Street from 1999 to 2005. After clocking up almost 400 episodes on Corrie, and another 500-plus on Hollyoaks, she plans to take full advantage of the opportunity to \u201cdecompress\u201d and enjoy some much-loved Saturday lie-ins. \u201cOf course I love what I do, it\u2019s what I\u2019ve done since I was young, so I\u2019d love to dive straight into my next acting job if that\u2019s a possibility, but actually for the first time in a long time I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Ooh if I want to go away this weekend, I can just go!\u2019\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m going to indulge in that a bit while I can, decompress and rest mentally and physically. I can recharge for a bit and then get cracking.\u201d Nikki opened up a few years ago about struggling with depression in her twenties, and revealed that she relied on her incredible support network, especially her mum Jude, as well as therapy and medication to help her recover. Now that she\u2019s the happiest she\u2019s ever been, she tells us, she\u2019s more comfortable sharing her experience.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve suffered in the past and I didn\u2019t talk about it because, let\u2019s face it, up until recently it was a bit of a taboo subject,\u201d she shares. \u201cI think it\u2019s fantastic that nowadays people can openly talk about mental health. And if they\u2019re struggling, there\u2019s so many places and people and organisations to be able to get help. But I\u2019m lucky that right now I\u2019m in a really good place. Also, there\u2019s a huge link between my physical and mental health, so when I\u2019m working out and being healthy, I feel better about myself, and I think it radiates.\u201d Nikki, who won the Inside Soap Award for Outstanding Achievement in 2023, has tackled some difficult topics as Maxine \u2013 from domestic abuse, coping with a terminal illness, ending a pregnancy and suffering Munchausen syndrome.\n\nDespite the weeks and months spent filming what were sometimes extremely harrowing scenes, Nikki says she\u2019s fiercely proud of her work, especially her domestic abuse storyline with co-star Jeremy Sheffield, who played Patrick Blake. She also filmed a special episode in 2022, The Long Walk Home, in which Maxine was violently attacked after finding herself navigating her way home alone after a girl\u2019s night out. It was made with input from the Government\u2019s Enough campaign, which tackles violence against females.\n\n\u201cWhat made it so great was not just how they wrote it and shot it, but how everything was so relatable,\u201d Nikki says. \u201cA lot of people could say, \u2018I\u2019ve been in that situation, I\u2019ve felt those same feelings, I have felt that fear\u2019. The whole thing was just phenomenal.\u201d\n\nGiven how emotionally draining some of her storylines have been, how has she coped with the physical and emotional burden of her role for so long? \u201cYou need the support system,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you were to stay in that state of mind for a long period of time it\u2019s extremely difficult to break out or snap out of it. When I\u2019ve been doing storylines like that I try to make sure that when I finish work, I mentally finish.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019ll get on the phone to my partner, or to my family or my friends, and talk about happy things, good things, and make plans.\u201d Nikki is very aware that she\u2019s lucky enough to be able to \u201cdecompress\u201d at the end of the day, and knows that many others aren\u2019t so fortunate because \u201cthey\u2019re living it, it\u2019s their life\u201d.\n\n\u201cSome of the storylines that I\u2019m most grateful for have been really quite dark, and I like to really research topics and know what I\u2019m doing, so I get very immersed in them,\u201d she shares. \u201cI know there are very real victims out there of these very real circumstances who will be watching and you want to do them justice for what they\u2019ve been through, and the trauma they\u2019ve been through.\u201d While the details of her final scenes are top secret, Nikki reveals they\u2019ll involve some of the cast she first filmed with, including Anna Passey (who plays Sienna Blake), Tamara Wall (Grace Black) and Danny Mac (Dodger Savage).\n\nHer departure will be bittersweet as she\u2019ll miss many of her co-stars, she says, but the friendships she has made will long outstay Maxine. After spending much of her working life on soaps, which were once considered in the industry as almost jobs for life, Nikki is excited \u2013 and understandably nervous \u2013 about dipping her toe back into the world of auditions. \u201cNow you have show reels and self tapes, but I never had to do that as you were just in a room with a casting director,\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the digital CV, whereas before you had the Spotlight catalogue which was like a Yellow Pages for actors!\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about learning about this new world but I also have fear because I\u2019m under no illusions of how the industry works, and there\u2019s always the potential that you\u2019ll never work again. \u201cBut I want to be as positive as possible and see myself in these really incredible productions out there, and I\u2019ll do everything in my power to be able to do that.\u201d\n\nAnd what about the question that seems to follow every former Corrie character... would she ever step back onto the cobbles? \u201cNever say never is my approach,\u201d she replies. \u201cI love Candice and I love Coronation Street, so I\u2019d never close myself to anything if they did want me back in the future, that\u2019s the exciting thing about doing what I do. You just never know what might happen next. \u201cWho knew way back when as a little girl going to drama classes at The Carol Godby Theatre Workshop I\u2019d spend the next 30 years working because of them? \u201cI\u2019m under no illusion that it\u2019s much tougher than it used to be out there, but I\u2019m positive and have faith that I\u2019ll achieve all I dream of in life, especially having Anthony, my family, and my friends by my side.\u201d", "summary": "EXCLUSIVE: Hollyoaks actress Nikki Sanderson confirms her exit from the show after 12 years as Maxine Minniver and also talks turning 40 and her happy relationship", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/nikki-sanderson-difficult-decision-exclusive-34770379", "image": "https://i2-prod.ok.co.uk/incoming/article34773184.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SOCIAL-IMAGE-irror-exclusive-rightV2.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 07:00:00", "author": "Mitya Underwood", "authors": ["Mitya Underwood"], "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.598}, {"id": 295550888, "title": "Keir Starmer says he won't tell people to cut down on kebabs to tackle climate crisis", "text": "Keir Starmer has said he won't tell people to cut down on kebabs to tackle the climate crisis.\n\nThe pescatarian Prime Minister said slashing carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 and firing up clean power was \"so important for the next generation and generations to come\".\n\nBut he said he wouldn't tell people how to run their lives.

We want to give her something big,\u2019\u201d she adds.\n\n\u201cOnce I got my head around the fact that getting this story is the better of those two options, then I was really excited to do it all.\u201d\n\nThe star managed to keep her exit a secret from friends and family \u2013 although she did warn her mum about the traumatic scenes to come. \u201cI said, \u2018I don\u2019t know if you should be watching this, it\u2019s going to be a lot for you to watch,\u2019\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut lots of my family and friends had no idea. People kept asking me, \u2018How\u2019s everything at work?\u2019 I was like, 'Yeah, it\u2019s good!\u2019 I could be a spy!\u201d\n\nAs for what lies ahead for her, Natalie is back in the swing of auditioning again and fancies trying something completely different to her emotional soap scenes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to do some comedy, having just done something so heavy,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI would love to do some theatre.\u201d\n\n Having kept her Emmerdale departure a secret, Natalie feels there\u2019s one reality show she would be a natural for \u2013 The Traitors \u2019 celebrity edition. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to float my own boat but I\u2019m very good at The Traitors,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been playing it for years because it\u2019s a drama game. We were on holiday with all of our friends one year in Lanzarote and Ali was coordinating the game for everyone.\n\n\u201cA couple of girls next to us said, \u2018Excuse me \u2013 where did you hire him from?\u2019 We were just drama geeks doing it for fun. We\u2019re gutted we didn\u2019t come up with the idea for The Traitors because we\u2019d be drama geek millionaires.\u201d\n\nStrictly Come Dancing may be a no-go though. \u201cI\u2019d be fighting a losing battle because people are so good at dancing when they start on there and I\u2019d be starting from scratch,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d have to do a little tester with them to see if I\u2019d be OK. I wouldn\u2019t be going in there confidently, whereas with I\u2019m A Celeb I would be on an equal playing field.\u201d \n\nWith more time on her hands, Natalie is hoping to learn British Sign Language \u2013 a topic she is deeply passionate about as someone with hearing issues herself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in learning sign language and I have bad hearing in one ear which I can use a hearing aid for,\u201d she says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t need to use BSL for myself but I like the idea of being able to interact with anybody who does need to. It\u2019s a shame that BSL isn\u2019t an option in school. I would definitely have chosen that.\u201d\n\n Natalie has made friends for life on Emmerdale \u2013 her co-stars Jonny McPherson (Dr Liam Cavanagh) and Olivia Bromley (Dawn Taylor) became emotional when she broke the news that she was leaving. \u201cI told Liv and Jonny on the day I found out what the exit was going to be. We did a lot of crying,\u201d she says. \u201cI went round and specifically told Ash and it was really sad. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll still see them all the time in normal life, but when you work with someone under the circumstances that we do, we do a lot of highly emotional things together and spend time making those really deep bonds. The hardest part was telling everybody I was going.\u201d\n\nHowever, the cast gave Natalie a suitably riotous send-off. \u201cI got three lovely bunches of flowers and five bottles of champagne \u2013 I don\u2019t know what that says about me,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI got a beautiful bracelet. There\u2019s writing on the outside that says, \u2018Love, The Village\u2019. And a Newcastle United cup that says Wyatt 9 on the back.\u201d\n\n Natalie\u2019s exit comes at a tricky time for ITV soaps, with the broadcaster scaling back its soap schedule and Coronation Street and Emmerdale episodes cut to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, a number of redundancies are rumoured across soap staff. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand when things are so popular why there are cutbacks,\u201d Natalie says. \u201cHowever, going back to half an hour episodes \u2013 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing. That\u2019s how I remember soaps back in the day, so it doesn\u2019t feel like a cutback.\u201d\n\nNo matter what she does next, Natalie will always miss her Emmerdale co-stars \u2013 and Amy\u2019s \u201cchaotic\u201d dress sense. \u201cI\u2019m sure I can do something about that in my own life though,\u201d she laughs.\n\nJoin The Mirror\u2019s WhatsApp Community or follow us on Google News , Flipboard , Apple News, TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads - or visit The Mirror homepage.", "summary": "Emmerdale star Natalie Ann Jamieson opens up to The Mirror's Notebook in an exclusive chat about her exit from the ITV soap, her future plans and why she's considering adoption", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/emmerdales-amy-star-natalie-ann-34771693", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article34771829.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RLP_CHP_280225EMMERDALE_19069JPG.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 07:00:00", "author": "Lauren Morris", "authors": ["Lauren Morris"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.085}, {"id": 295550886, "title": "Shoppers who swear by 'head turning' perfume rush to buy it at 'no brainer' price", "text": "A 'stunning' designer perfume, known for its 'breathtaking' aroma that never fails to 'turn heads', has seen a significant price drop.

This pain could be constant or it came and went and it ranged from mild to severe pain.\"\n\nThe American Cancer Society confirms that most patients with Ewing tumours will feel pain in the area of the tumour, often worsening at night, which aligns with Graeme's experience.\n\nWeight loss \n\n In addition to the pain, Graeme shockingly lost between three and four stone within a mere five weeks, spanning from the Easter break until his return home from university. \n\nMedicalNewsToday highlights that such rapid weight loss is another symptom of this rare cancer, predominantly affecting individuals aged 10 to 20. It advises anyone experiencing unexplained weight loss to consult a doctor immediately, reports Bristol Live. \n\nThe third symptom that raised alarm for Graeme was fatigue, a common issue among those suffering from Ewing sarcoma, adding to the challenges he faces while fighting this aggressive disease.\n\nGraeme opened up about his battle with a rare cancer, sharing that fatigue was a major symptom he faced: \"Tiredness was also a thing. All of these amounted to me struggling to do daily activities which started to affect my daily life.\"\n\nThe NHS acknowledges that while some individuals with Ewing sarcoma may not exhibit any symptoms, severe tiredness can occur, though it's less common than pain in the affected area.\n\nWhen Graeme's mum rushed him to A&E in May 2023, they had no clue about the gravity of his situation. Initially suspected to be kidney stones, a biopsy conducted the next month disclosed a grim reality \u2013 Ewing sarcoma in his lower spine, accompanied by a ten-centimetre mass that had spread to his lungs.\n\nRecalling the harrowing diagnosis, Graeme said: \"You hear about young people going through cancer but you never expect it to be yourself. My parents and myself felt like we were shoved in the deepest ocean. Also being told your child is incurable, my parents broke down. My mum rushed out the room with a breakdown and I sat in silence, luckily we had some other relatives with us.\"\n\nFrom July to January, Graeme endured 14 cycles of chemotherapy and six weeks of radiotherapy. Now facing palliative care, he continues his fight with Ifosfamide, a chemo drug designed to halt the division and growth of cancer cells.\n\nWhen pressed about his remaining time, he shared: \"We are not too sure on a time frame. The chemo is doing its job so hopefully prolonging any time frame. Once the treatment options run out, and there are a few more to go afterwards, that is it really.\"\n\nSpreading positivity \n\nDespite his dire situation, Graeme's response has been incredibly positive. He spreads hope through his TikTok account, encouraging followers to join live streams and engage with him in Q&A sessions, and now aims to \"help other people see a positive light.\"\n\nOn the significance of maintaining a positive outlook, he mentioned: \"I would love to show people that cancer does not define me. Being told I have at worst a few days at best if my palliative chemo didn't work was a surreal moment that made me want to live everyday like it could be my last.\"\n\nFollowing an impactful first live stream on TikTok that attracted an audience of 35,000, Graeme's friend, Lily from Leicester, coordinated with his mother to initiate a GoFundMe campaign.\n\nThe fundraiser's goal is to gather enough funds to fulfill Graeme's childhood dream of visiting Australia. He told BristolLive, full of gratitude: \"It has been one of my childhood dreams to go visit Australia and see what the other side of the world has to offer. I am very thankful to the support that has happened so far.\"\n\nYou can make a donation to the GoFundMe here, to help make his last wish come true", "summary": "Graeme Porter, 20, from Aberdeen, has Ewing sarcoma, a rare cancer that can occur in bone and surrounding tissue.

Many of these symptoms confusingly overlap with other conditions, which is why 50% of women with the condition are either misdiagnosed or simply expected to live with it.\n\nHormone health expert Mike Kocsis from Balance My Hormones exclusively shared the essential signs every woman should be aware of and how better awareness can lead to earlier diagnosis and an improved quality of life.\n\nTo make things easier to understand, he first broke down exactly what someone with endometriosis is dealing with.\n\n\"Endometriosis occurs when tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. Unlike the tissue inside the uterus, which sheds during menstruation, the tissue outside the uterus has nowhere to go, leading to inflammation, pain, and, in some cases, scarring.\"\n\nScarily, he also added that the condition can impact various organs including the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bladder, and bowel. \"Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to severe chronic pain and infertility.\"\n\nBut as any woman knows, time of the month pains are par for the course and symptoms can vary from person to person, but Mike surges us to all pay attention to the hidden symptoms that are often overlooked as other conditions such as asthma, IBS and simple tiredness.\n\n\"While most people associate endometriosis with painful periods, it can cause a variety of other symptoms that are often overlooked or confused with other conditions,\" said Mike.\n\nChronic Fatigue\n\nWomen with endometriosis may experience extreme tiredness, not only due to pain but also because of the body\u2019s ongoing inflammation. Even after a full night\u2019s sleep, women can feel drained throughout the day, and this fatigue is often mistakenly attributed to stress or poor sleep.\n\nBreathing Problems and Chest Pain\n\nSome women with endometriosis may experience shortness of breath or chest pain. This occurs when endometrial tissue grows on the diaphragm or lungs, leading to rare conditions like catamenial pneumothorax (collapsed lung) or breathing issues during menstruation. These symptoms can easily be mistaken for asthma or other respiratory conditions.\n\nChronic Leg Pain or Sciatica\n\nEndometriosis can affect pelvic nerves, leading to pain radiating down the legs or into the lower back. This can resemble sciatica, causing numbness, tingling, or discomfort in the legs, especially during menstruation.\n\nDigestive Issues\n\nMany women with endometriosis suffer from bloating, constipation, diarrhoea, or nausea. These symptoms often mimic irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which can lead to misdiagnosis and delay the correct treatment for endometriosis.\n\nPersistent Lower Back and Pelvic Pain\n\nUnexplained lower back or pelvic pain, especially during menstruation or sex, could be a sign of endometriosis. Pain that persists for several days or recurs regularly may indicate a deeper issue.\n\nPain During or After Sex\n\nEndometriosis often causes pain during or after intercourse due to inflammation of the pelvic lining. This discomfort can create intimacy struggles and emotional distress, adding another layer to the already challenging experience.\n\nUrinary and Bowel Distress\n\nWomen may experience frequent urination, painful urination, or discomfort during bowel movements. These symptoms are often misdiagnosed as urinary tract infections (UTIs) or gastrointestinal issues, which can delay the identification of endometriosis.\n\nInfertility\n\nEndometriosis is one of the leading causes of infertility. It can cause scarring and adhesions in the reproductive organs, making it more difficult to conceive. Around 30-50% of women with endometriosis struggle with fertility.\n\n Mike also revealed that it's not just the physical side of things that can take its toll - with woman enduring a heavy emotional impact, too.\n\n\"Many women experience feelings of isolation, anxiety, and depression due to the difficulty of being diagnosed and the constant pain they endure. Being told that their pain is 'normal' or just 'bad periods' can be incredibly frustrating, leading to feelings of invalidation and discouragement.\"\n\nThe emotional burden is compounded by the uncertainty surrounding the condition, especially when it comes to fertility. Mika added that this can \"strain relationships and contribute to a sense of social withdrawal.\"\n\n He added that the lack of understanding from healthcare professionals, especially general practitioners who are unfamiliar with endometriosis, can leave women feeling unsupported. This lack of empathy worsens the emotional burden of the condition.\n\nPositively, and despite there being no cure, there are ways to better manage the condition.\n\nEarly diagnosis and a multi-faceted approach to treatment are key to improving outcomes for women with the condition.\n\n Seek Proper Diagnosis \n\nIf you experience any of the hidden symptoms of endometriosis, it\u2019s essential to seek care from a healthcare provider who understands the condition. Don\u2019t hesitate to advocate for yourself\u2014request tests like an ultrasound or laparoscopy for an accurate diagnosis.\n\n Pain Management \n\nOver-the-counter pain medications, prescription drugs, and hormone therapies can help control pain. In more severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove excess endometrial tissue.\n\n Join Support Groups \n\nConnecting with other women who have endometriosis can provide much-needed emotional support. Online or in-person support groups offer opportunities to share experiences and coping strategies, helping reduce feelings of isolation.\n\n Lifestyle Changes \n\nMany women find relief through diet and exercise. An anti-inflammatory diet may help reduce pain and inflammation, while regular physical activity can boost energy levels and reduce stress.\n\n Mental Health Support \n\nGiven the emotional toll of endometriosis, seeking therapy or counselling is essential. Mental health professionals can help manage anxiety, depression, and stress, allowing women to cope better with the demands of the condition.", "summary": "This Endometriosis Awareness Month, it\u2019s vital to raise awareness of the hidden symptoms that many women live with every day if there's chance for better management and quality of life", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/8-hidden-endometriosis-symptoms-you-34773780", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article34773840.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EXCLUSIVE-MAIN-copy.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 07:04:00", "author": "Alison Graves", "authors": ["Alison Graves"], "language": "en", "category": "sports", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.492}, {"id": 295550878, "title": "Beat Shark's price on handheld vacuum and get it for less using this deal stack", "text": "One of the most popular handheld vacuums has been reduced to almost half price thanks to a limited stack deal.

Police found no criminal evidence so the Chandlet family filed a lawsuit, eventually settled to around \u00a315million on January 25, 1994.\n\nSince then, Jordan - or Jordy as he is known - has kept a low profile but sources close to him today spoke of his difficult journey since the legal fight. Friends say the man is still apprehensive about attacks from Jackson's fans - more than 30 years on from the allegations.\n\nHe is said to be even more on edge as Michael, the new biopic of the singer, is soon due for release, with the star's own nephew Jafaar portraying the musician.\n\nJordy, now 44, lives in California. He has never married or had children, according to sources. His dad, a dentist, took his own life in November 2009, months after Jackson's suicide.\n\nDiane Dimond, who broke the story back in 1993 and has written a book about the Michael Jackson-Jordy Chandler scandal called Be Careful Who You Love: Inside The Michael Jackson Case, told Mail Online today: \"I think maybe he's realised \u2013 he's been through a lot of therapy \u2013 what happened, with either the molestation or his father, wasn't his fault.\n\n\"I remember in 1993, going to his house, seeing the hordes of fans sitting on the front lawn, throwing faeces at the front door. The world came down on his family's head.\"\n\nThe fateful encounter between Jordy, then 12, and Michael Jackson in the spring of 1992 was pure chance. Jackson's limo broke down in Santa Monica and the driver asked for help at a depot of the car hire company Rent-A-Wreck. The boss was Jordy's stepfather, David Schwarz. He arranged for his starry-eyed stepson to meet Jackson, who then appeared to develop an obsession with Jordy.\n\nJordy's brother Ray said in an interview in 2004 his sibling struggled with the \"weight\" of being the boy, then man, at the heart of the scandal. He added: \"Despite the fact that he's got a lot of money he'll always be the Michael Jackson kid,' he says. 'It's a heavy weight to tote around.\n\n\"Whenever he starts with a new social group someone figures it out and he can't stay in the group because people continue to talk about it. 'How much money did you get? Did he do it?\"\n\nHowever, the biopic will not feature anything about the case. Unbeknown to the filmmakers, the estate allegedly signed a contract with the Chandler family that prevents them from depicting him or any of his family in a motion picture. Now major scenes have had to be reshot.\n\nJust as Jordy struggled to escape the limelight, Jackson was accused again of abuse by child cancer survivor Gavin Arvizo in 2003.

It was my responsibility to enlist only the best candidates so I was forced to come up with lots of subtle personality tests to determine the best man for the job (if I remember correctly women were not allowed jobs until the late 80s, and even then only as secretaries or nurses or eye candy).\n\nOne of the first things I'd do with a new candidate is lay a salt lick and a lemon drop on the table in front of them. I would ask them which piece of candy they wanted. Remember, if you would, that candy was given out like jobs and it was a not-so-subtle metaphor for a job.

Todd Inman spoke out about the impact on the families: \"They're all just hurt and they want answers, and we want to give them answers,\" he said. \"It's horrible. No one has to suffer this.\"\n\nAbove the small town of \u00dcberlingen in Germany, 22 years ago - another shocking mid-air collision occurred - killing all 71 people on boards - leaving all relatives desperate for answers. The majority of those lost their lives were children. \n\n On July 1 2002, passeneger jet Bashkirian Airlines Flight 2937, and DHL International Aviation ME Flight 611, a Boeing 757 cargo jet, collided in mid-air over Uberluigen, a southern German town on Lake Constance near the German-Swiss border. \n\nThe passenger jet was flying from Moscow to Barcelona and had a total of 69 occupants including the crew. There were 45 Russian schoolchildren on the flight on a school trip. \n\n The DHL cargo flight was flying from Bergamo to Brussels and had two pilots on board. \n\n Relatives of the deceased were horrified to discover that Peter Nielsen, the controller at Zurich who was solely controlling the air space did not know the the ground-based optical collision warning system at the control tower in Zurich, Switzerland had been switched off for maintenance that fateful night. \n\nNielsen worked for the Swiss federal airspace control Skyguide.\n\nThe system would have alerted him to the impending disaster about two minutes before it happened - enough time to prevent disaster. Instead he only noticed and advised the crew 43 seconds before the collision.\n\nBoth planes had TCAS (traffic alert and collision avoidance systems) and both systems were working correctly. However while the pilots of the DHL plane obeyed TCAS's instruction to descend, the Russian crews were told by TCAS to climb but instead they followed Neilson's instruction to descend - putting them right back in the path of the DRL flight.\n\nNielsen had also told the Russians crews to look out for the plane from the right. When the DHL plane was actually coming from the left. \n\nThis grave error doomed all on board the two planes. \n\nRussian architect Vitaly Kaloyev lost three people he loved in the crash - his wife Svetlana and two children, 10-year-old Konstantin and 4-year-old Diana. Vitaly was working in Spain at the time and it was a much longed for family reunion.\n\nIn 2004, while investigators were writing up the final report, crazed with grief Vitaly Flew into Zurich. \n\nHe went to Nielsen's house and stabbed him to death. He found Nielsen in his garden and plunged a 14cm knife into his stomach before fleeing the scene.\n\nHe was arrested at Zurich airport and charged with murder.\n\nThe dad was given an eight-year prison term for killing Neilsen. \n\nHowever, his sentence was later reduced after a Swiss judge ruled that he had acted with diminished responsibility. \n\nAfter completing two-thirds of his term and receiving parole, Kaloyev was freed from prison on November 8th, 2007.\n\nSpeaking on National Geographic Channel's Air Crash Investigation Vitaly says of the killing: \"This was not revenge. This was punishment,\" Vitaly says of the killing.\n\n\"I wanted to hear them say we are responsible but forgive us if possible. They had killed so many children but nothing had happened. No apologies. No expressions of sorry.\"\n\nThe final report into the crash said that a chain of errors and technical problems led to a mid-air collision. Nielsen made mistakes but was also overworked. The Swiss air traffic control system Skyguide suffered serious technical problems that night and had failed properly to organize the night shift.\n\nSkyguide paid out compensation to the families which was equivalent of $22,300 \u2013 26,700 for each victim. \n\nIn September 2007, three Skyguide managers were given suspended prison terms and a fourth was ordered to pay a fine.\n\nThe 2017 Aftermath a film featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a character based on Kaloyev, is partly based on the \u00dcberlingen midair crash.", "summary": "As families of the Washington DC crash victims await answers from the investigation, The Mirror looks back on the \u00dcberlingen air crash where one grieving father took the law into his own hands", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russian-plane-horror-grieving-dad-34756356", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article34772646.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_SPLIT.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:15:00", "author": "Sanjeeta Bains", "authors": ["Sanjeeta Bains"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.587}, {"id": 295550874, "title": "Alan Shearer makes Manchester United vs Fulham FA Cup prediction - 'Tough one'", "text": "Alan Shearer expects Manchester United to lose to Fulham in their FA Cup fifth round tie to prolong the \"tough situation\" facing head coach Ruben Amorim.\n\nAmorim got a welcome three points in midweek, with Harry Maguire scoring United's winner against Ipswich Town in the Premier League.

The former Little Mix star, 32, took matters into her own hands during lockdown and slid into his DMs to let him know she was interested in him.\n\n Her bold move worked, as it seems the attraction was mutual, and the pair struck up a conversation. However, because of the restrictions around socialising during the Coronavirus outbreak, they couldn\u2019t meet up in person, so they had to get creative. Much like many isolated individuals at the time, they made use of the benefits of the digital world and opted for virtual hookups. \n\nSpeaking on The Jonathan Ross Show, Jade previously explained: \"I met someone in lockdown. We met on Zoom. I slid into the DMs. Then we had some Zoom dates.\" She also revealed how they decided to get into the spirit of the video conferencing platform that lots of businesses were using at the time for work meetings and catch-ups. \n\n\"Jordan and I did a few Zoom dates in lockdown,\" she added. \"We made a joke and said it was business. We put suits and ties on and asked each other questions. I did the full shebang, a full suit. Then we had a socially distanced date in Greenwich Park, apart from each other just chatting.\"\n\n The loved-up pair were photographed on holiday in Venice, and their relationship was confirmed at the Black Lives Matter march in London in July 2020. They went Instagram official in September of that year and have been together ever since but prefer to keep a low profile when it comes to their personal life, only occasionally sharing pictures on social media.\n\nHowever, Jade revealed rather intimate details about her 33-year-old man when she was interviewed by Radio 1 DJ Greg James . They were discussing whether her fellow pop star and pumped fitness fanatic Tom Grennan would be in the gym. Greg said he found it \"annoying\" that shorter men can get \"big quite quickly\" when working out. \n\nThe conversation then turned to Jade\u2019s partner, Jordan. Presenter Greg asked: \"Jordan\u2019s quite tall, isn\u2019t he? He\u2019s quite buil,t isn\u2019t he?\" Jade was rather more open in her reply than expected: \"Yeah, he\u2019s over 6ft. He\u2019s got a lovely physique that one, a lovely bit of kit,\" she cheekily said.\n\nAs producers in the studio burst into laughter at the raunchy confession, presenter Greg joked: \"I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s no way we can\u2019t make that into a social media clip. Sorry. We\u2019ve got to give the people what they want. He\u2019s got a fantastic rig, and it needs to be celebrated.\"\n\nJordan has previously spoken about his special relationship with Jade and how close they are. According to the Daily Mail he shared his deep feelings for her at Kite Festival: \"I have to give a shout out to my current girlfriend. The relationship I\u2019m in now I feel secure and safe. I feel love and I feel connected to a person,\" he said. \"I didn\u2019t have an understanding that I could feel love like this.\"\n\n Fantasy singer Jade is the first member of Little Mix, who went on hiatus in 2023 to earn recognition for their solo material. She was over the moon to be nominated for the coveted Brit Award Song of the Year for her debut single, Angel of My Dreams, and the fan-voted Best Pop Act. She has enjoyed incredible success since launching her solo career last June when the single secured a top 10 place in the charts. \n\n Talking to presenter Sian Welby during the live Brit Awards nominations broadcast, she discussed how it felt different being nominated as a solo artist. \"Well, obviously, as a band, we were nominated a few times, and obviously, that\u2019s amazing,\" she said. \"We won, I think, three Brit Awards over the last 10 years, but when it\u2019s for your own music and from my own personal experiences, it does hit differently; it feels extra special.\"", "summary": "Former Little Mix singer Jade Thirlwall, who was nominated for two Brit Awards, left a Radio 1 DJ flustered after revealing an intimate detail about her lover", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/brits-star-jade-thirlwalls-explicit-34752698", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article34752855.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2021-10-31-at-075825.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 07:00:00", "author": "Beth Hardie", "authors": ["Beth Hardie"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.386}, {"id": 295550866, "title": "The scary numbers behind PSG's preparations for Liverpool Champions League clash", "text": "So much for the seeding.

Liverpool accepted a bid and I was going to the training ground to pack my stuff. Rafa convinced me to come into the office and we spent one hour discussing it.\n\n\"Even after one hour I said, 'No, I don't want to stay, the club accepted a transfer.' He said to me, 'If you come back to me in January and I don't play you, I'll let you go, whatever you want.' I said, 'OK, deal.'

However, his most memorable contribution to Reds history is his aforementioned goal-line clearance in the Champions League final. \n\nThat pivotal moment almost didn't occur as Benitez initially planned to substitute Traore at half-time but had to keep him on due to Steve Finnan's injury. Reflecting on that sequence of events, Traore added: \"Maybe it was destiny.\n\n\"I was poor in the first half and I tried to help the team and contribute. Maybe I helped the team to win that night with that save on the line. The spirit of the team was very high.

This marks the biggest drop in the entirety of the UK, and is significantly lower than the UK average (\u00a3267,700) - not to mention more than half the cost of a home in London (\u00a3543,000). \n\nGwynedd is home to the renowned Barmouth Beach, a Blue Flag shore that has a stellar reputation for remaining clean and unspoilt. It's a proper tourist magnet, but due to its vast size means you'll never have to rub shoulders with strangers while sunbathing. The sand is gold and soft, the water clear, and you get a stunning backdrop of Cardigan Bay and the picturesque harbour. If you're feeling brave, this area is a great place to go for a dip or try your hand at water sports such as surfing. \n\nThe beach is located in the popular town of Abermaw. This destination has kept that nostalgically British seaside feel that has slowly been eradicated from struggling coastal resorts. It is filled with amusement arcades, fish and chip shops, and ice cream vans - there are also donkey rides on the shore, and a land train that runs along the promenade.\n\n\"There are several delightful walks of varying distance which start in Barmouth and follow routes into the hills beyond,\" explains Visit Wales, the country's official tourist board. \"At low tide, it is possible to walk all the way to Harlech to the north with wonderful views over Tremadog Bay. The town is located on Route 8 of the National Cycle Network and the traffic-free trail from Barmouth to Dolgellau along the Mawddach Estuary offers spectacular views.\"\n\nYasmin Shaheen-Zaffar, a relationship and trauma counsellor, has enjoyed many summers in Gwynedd. Back in 2011, her partner purchased a second home in Nefyn, a seaside town on the northwest coast of the Ll\u0177n Peninsula, for \u00a3345,000. It's an hour's drive away from Barmouth Beach, but boasts its own secluded sands and breathtaking vistas.\n\n\"At the time, my daughter was eight so we've had idyllic holidays throughout the school holidays while she was growing up,\" Yasmin said in an exclusive interview with the Mirror. \"It's literally 100 steps I know because I've counted from the coast. I love the area, the walks, the sea air, and the local businesses... There are some great small businesses, bakeries, and coffee shops [around].\"\n\nYasmin used to go for walks along the beautiful coast over to the Nefyn Golf Club, before heading up to see the nearby lighthouse. \"After lockdown, as my daughter really didn't want to spend time hanging out with her folks, I sponsored three Ukrainian artists who lived there for two years \u2026\" the counsellor added. \"They have now become independent and we've put the house on the market as it's the end of a chapter. I would recommend [Gwynedd to] people if you want peace quiet, genuine people, and a quieter life. There's lots of creatives around Gwynedd with some amazing art galleries, and a sense of creative community.\"\n\nWhen asked why house prices may have fallen in the region, Yasmin pointed the blame at the hike in council tax premiums for holiday homes. Back in 2013, the council tax premium for second homes was increased from 100 per cent to 150 per cent - as local authority Cyngor Gwynedd pledged to spend the money on tackling homelessness. The move resulted in the number of second homes in Gwynned falling by five per cent, but aimed to make homes more affordable for younger local people. \n\nIn theory, this has worked. The average price paid by first-time buyers was \u00a3167,000 in December 2024. This marks a 4.7 per cent decrease compared to the average of \u00a3175,000 the year before.\n\nWant the latest travel news and cheapest holiday deals sent straight to your inbox?

Speaking to the Mirror, she raved about the area's 'wonderful combination of stunning natural scenery and strong community bonds'. \"The mix of mountains, beaches, and historical elements transforms everyday life into something truly extraordinary,\" she added.\n\nJennifer recommends living in Gwynedd if you prefer a 'slower, peaceful pace of life'. However, she warns its far-out location, which allows for such stunning scenery, can sometimes feel a little 'distant' from the rest of the UK. Still, she says it's an 'ideal home for those who value natural surroundings along with cultural offerings and close community bonds'.\n\nHowever, not all parts of Gwynned are so fondly spoken of. Last year, the city of Bangor was voted the worst seaside resort in the UK. In a survey of 4,700 Brits, many respondents snubbed the area - arguing it had become 'run down' and 'drab'. Despite the scathing poll, plans to help regenerate the city centre are already underway, including a new \u00a330 million health and wellbeing hub. \n\nMany locals were also enraged by the unwanted title, including Branwen Jones, a journalist at Wales Online, who argued thousands of respondents had completely misunderstood the city. You can read her column here. Visit Wales has also praised Bangor, stating it combines 'fascinating history with a modern vibe' due to its student population. \"And the setting between Eryri (Snowdonia) mountains and glistening waters of the Menai Strait couldn't be more spectacular,\" the tourist board added.\n\n*House prices based on data from the Land Registry.

This is the earlier expedition, the formative expedition, in which so many of those people who became famous later on such as Shackleton, cut their teeth.\u201d\n\nThe guest added that the photographs had been taken from the Discovery Expedition which was Captain Scott\u2019s first to the Antarctic.\n\nAllum elaborated: \u201cWell let\u2019s open it up, because what we have is an album of silver gelatin photographs and this first one says \u2018Morning leaving NZ\u2019.\n\n\u201cNow on the spine we saw the name Colbeck, now that\u2019s Captain William Colbeck who was the captain of Morning.\n\n\u201cEssentially what he was doing on the Morning was going to relieve the Discovery, which was ice locked.\n\n\u201cSo they set off with more provisions, men to obviously try and help Scott and what we have is an original collection of photographs.\n\n\u201cI think these were mainly probably taken by Donald Morrison who was the chief engineer on Morning.\n\n\u201cWe can see many, many photographs of icebergs, ice shelves and then suddenly we start to get more intimate pictures of life on board, the ship covered in ice, walrus that they were basically hunting to eat. It really is an incredible collection of photographs.\u201d\n\nHe then stated that when Morning arrived to release the Discovery, they couldn\u2019t get too close and so in the end, \u201cthey dynamited the ice to break out the Discovery\u201d.\n\nAllum\u2019s excitement was briefly dampened by the presentation of the photographs: \u201cWhat I immediately noticed about it, is that it\u2019s not in an original binding. Do you know anything about why it\u2019s in this binding and how long ago this was done?\u201d\n\nThe guest replied: \u201cSo we don\u2019t know much about the album itself or where the photographs have come from but we think the actual binding was probably done by the library maybe in the 1990s.\u201d\n\nThe expert expressed: \u201cThat worries me a little bit, because I would have loved to have seen the album or binding they were originally contained in, because I believe that Morrison would have certainly annotated some of these photographs by hand and I can\u2019t see the backs of them either so there might be something on the backs of them. That\u2019s something that intrigues me as well.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, he was ready to put a figure to the book: \u201cI know it\u2019s never going to be sold because it belongs to the people of Leeds but I don\u2019t have any hesitation in putting \u00a320,000 to \u00a33000 on this album.\u201d\n\nThe audience gasped as the guest took a step back in surprise, stating: \u201cWow. That\u2019s incredible. But of course, we will never sell it. That\u2019s really great to know.\u201d\n\nAllum laughed: \u201cWell for once in my life, I actually believe you!\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an absolute privilege to look at this.

Absolute Collagen's Marine liquid collagen sachets are one such supplement, and have not only been clinically proven to reduce fine lines, wrinkles and improve skin evenness in just 12 weeks, but are a firm favourite with celebrities, too. \n\nAnd for a limited time, customers can now save 30% when they sign up for their first Absolute Collagen subscription. But they\u2019ll need to be quick, because the offer ends on Monday, March 3.\n\n Typically priced at \u00a327.99 for a two-week supply, shoppers can get their first fortnight's supply for \u00a319.60 - equating to \u00a31.40 per day - ideal for those wanting to incorporate a collagen supplement into their daily routine without breaking the bank. \n\n READ MORE: I asked 16 celebriti es what their must-have beauty product is and this is what they told me \n\n READ MORE: 'I asked Next employee to choose my outfit and more than one item made it into my wardrobe' \n\n Each handy 10ml sachet is packed with 8000mg of high-grade marine collagen peptides and 60mg of vitamin C. Whether you're at home or out and about, you can take your daily dose straight from the easy-tear sachet or mix it into food and drinks, Bristol Live reports. \n\n In addition to benefiting the skin, Absolute Collagen liquid supplements have also been clinically proven to reduce hair damage and enhance hair shine. Once consumed, the marine collagen is absorbed and distributed to the deep layers of the skin, stimulating and increasing your body's own natural collagen production. This helps to promote skin rejuvenation, glowing skin, thicker hair and stronger nails. \n\n The Absolute Collagen Marine Liquid Collagen Supplement comes highly recommended by industry experts, with trichologist Eva Proudman stating: \u201cAbsolute Collagen is the only clinically proven collagen supplement to have benefits for the hair, skin and nails. An amazing 32% of people saw an improvement in their hair with many seeing improvements to the scalp, hair thickness and density, with an overall 27% increase in hair strands.\u201d \n\n And it\u2019s not just loved by the experts, the Absolute Collagen supplement has more than 2,000 5-star reviews on their website. Giving the supplement five stars, Kathleen said: \u201cMy skin feels amazing. I turn 57 next month and my skin has never looked so good so thank you.\u201d \n\nAnother fan, Rebecca, commented: \u201cSince taking this my skin feels and looks much fresher, my hair has grown and is feeling fuller and thicker.\u201d\n\n \u201cI am now five months into my AC journey, and I have to say that I\u2019ve seen lots of improvements,\u201d said a customer called Karen, \u201cMy skin is clearer, my eyes brighter and my nails are so strong and grow so quickly. It\u2019s a game-changer.\u201d \n\nHowever, not everyone has seen the results they\u2019d hoped for, with Bernadette leaving a two star review which read: \u201cHave now been taking absolute collagen for just over three weeks disappointed at the moment was hoping it will help with my nails but no improvement will keep taking for a while longer and see. Haven't notice any differences in my hair or skin. Will give it another month is no change will unsubscribe as the product is not cheap to keep taking.\u201d\n\nPresenter Emma Willis, who is 48, is also a fan of the formula. The Love Is Blind host said: \u201cAbsolute Collagen\u2019s award-winning daily supplement, it\u2019s what keeps me feeling like Emma Willis. Its expert-backed, unique formula supports my skin from the inside, for me to feel my absolute best.\u201d\n\n If you\u2019d prefer a powder supplement, the Applied Nutrition Marine Collagen Powder can be purchased from Amazon for \u00a321.99 and it comes in three flavours - Strawberry and Lemonade, Cherry and Apple, and Strawberry and Raspberry. For those who prefer no flavour, there's also an unflavoured version. \n\n The 300g Marine Collagen provides up to 25 servings and aims to enhance the natural protein in your body that improves the appearance of skin, hair, and nails. It's suggested to mix the powder with your daily drink or meal for a \"healthy\" collagen boost. \n\n Or, if you want to harness the power of marine collagen in your skincare routine, there are few products as renowned as the Elemis Pro-Collagen Marine Cream SPF30 - used by the likes of Molly-Mae Hague and Kate Hudson. It acts as a 3-in-1 face cream to \"deeply moisturise\" and \"firm\" your skin. It\u2019s formulated with powerful marine and plant actives to deliver \"instant hydration\" that \"plumps\" the skin.

The environmentalist saw the irony in performing at a former coal-fired facility, waxed lyrical about our infamous Sunday sessions and unveiled a slow-burning cover of Beds Are Burning and rockier rendition of Blue Sky Mine.\n\nFestival fans were treated to the world premiere of God On My Side, a prescient song written by late Welsh singer-songwriter Kurt Wallinger with lyrics about people parading in \u201cstrange caps\u201d.\n\nReleased on the day of the concert (February 28), the track features the line: \u201cWell, I see you thought we could change the world\u201d.\n\nGarrett has been doing his best since joining Midnight Oil more than half a century ago. He\u2019d be the first to admit that he hasn\u2019t always got it right, but at least he has had a crack.\n\nWhile God On My Side might sound defeated, the great Australian protest rocker isn\u2019t putting his cue in the rack.\n\nDuring the encore, rowdy 1981 punk-rock number Don\u2019t Wanna Be the One segued into more recent Oils\u2019 song We Resist that concedes that while the \u201csummer of love\u201d is over we can still rage against the machine.\n\nThe verdict: 4 stars.", "summary": "Peter Garrett maintains the rage at East Perth Power Station gig with \u2018solo\u2019 band, the Alter Egos.", "url": "https://thewest.com.au/entertainment/perth-festival-peter-garrett-the-alter-egos-bring-passion-to-east-perth-power-station-gig-spiked-with-oils-c-17890780", "image": "https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-17890780/81189c76430ed419ab7d1605eb4db54a49630f06-16x9-x0y348w4746h2670.jpg?imwidth=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 07:12:52", "author": "Simon Collins", "authors": ["Simon Collins"], "language": "en", "source_country": "au", "sentiment": 0.333}, {"id": 295550832, "title": "Search for missing Beaumont children called off after failure to find human remains", "text": "Close navigation menu\n\nSubscriber Exclusive\n\nToday's Paper\n\nWest Rewards\n\nVanishing Cousins\n\nThe West Live\n\nCourt in the Act\n\nReveal sub navigationChevron Down Icon\n\nCourts & Justice\n\nReveal sub navigationChevron Down Icon\n\nWest Coast Eagles\nFremantle Dockers\n\nRugby Union\nHorse Racing\n\nReveal sub navigationChevron Down Icon\n\nHerd On The Terrace\n\nAgriculture\nBulls N\u2019 Bears\n\nReveal sub navigationChevron Down Icon\n\nWA Election 2025\nFederal Politics\nState Politics\nLocal Government\nWorld Politics\n\nReveal sub navigationChevron Down Icon\n\nGreat Southern\n\nPeel/Rockingham\n\nReveal sub navigationChevron Down Icon\n\nJessica Page\n\nKatina Curtis\nBasil Zempilas\nEmma Garlett\nKim MacDonald\nPaul Murray\nJustin Langer\nBelle Taylor\nLaura Newell\nAnxiety Aunt\n\nReveal sub navigationChevron Down Icon\n\nHealth & Wellbeing\n\nReal Estate\nHouse That!\n\nEntertainment\nReveal sub navigationChevron Down Icon\n\nCelebrity Gossip\n\nCompetitions & Puzzles\n\nReveal sub navigationChevron Down Icon\n\nWestern Australia\n\nWest Travel Club\nPhotography\nTravel Tips\n\nReveal sub navigationChevron Down Icon\n\nSmartphones\n\nTelecommunications\n\nThe West Australian\nToday's PaperPlace an AdSaturday, 1 March 2025\n\n Starts Thurs: $150K in prizes to be won with The Game Footy Tipping.

2-0 then 3-1 down to level the game at 3-3 through two Zach Clough penalties, Auckland captain Hiroki Sakai thought he'd scored the winner in the 92nd minute, before Bart Vriends bundled home a 98th-minute equaliser.\n\nAuckland (40 points) are eight points clear of second-placed Western United and third-placed Adelaide, but will feel they have thrown away a chance to all but clinch the premiers plate with eight games to go.\n\nSteve Corica's charges took the lead when Jake Brimmer found Guillermo May in midfield.\n\nThe Uruguayan maestro cut inside, worked the ball to his left and ripped a wonderful, unstoppable strike past Ethan Cox.\n\nFour minutes later Frances De Vries launched a long throw-in, and with Jay Barnett and Vriends both focused on defending striker Max Mata, May was able to ghost in behind them to bundle home.\n\nAdelaide argued Mata had pushed Barnett in the back, but it wasn't enough to overturn the goal.\n\nAdelaide hit back in the 32nd minute when Clough delivered a wonderful corner to the near post for Archie Goodwin, whose flick-header wrong-footed Alex Paulsen but didn't quite cross the line.\n\nElsey steamed in at the back post to slam the ball home.\n\nAuckland extended their lead in the 53rd minute when De Vries curled an excellent corner into a tantalising position for Logan Rogerson to head home amid a collective of bodies.\n\nAdelaide received a penalty on the hour mark after a VAR review determined Louis Verstraete kicked Ethan Alagich in the leg when he tried to challenge for the ball.\n\nPaulsen got a hand to Clough's spot-kick, but it wasn't enough to keep the ball out.\n\nAdelaide received a second penalty when Tommy Smith legged Stefan Mauk as the midfielder burst through the 18-yard box.\n\nWhile Auckland felt the penalty was a soft one, Clough again made no mistake to equalise in the 79th minute, with Corica booked in the aftermath.\n\nIn injury time, Cox spilled a close-range effort from Sakai and the Japanese star coolly drilled his second attempt past the goalkeeper.\n\nBut Vriends bundled home a chaotic effort at the death to snatch a point.", "summary": "Adelaide United and ladder leaders Auckland FC have

huge economic benefits for the country, says the Minister of Natural Resources and Climate Change, Owen Chomanika.\n\nAccording to Chomanika, the tuber is an important plant that should be grown at household level to improve people\u2019s lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very profitable. We have to domesticate it,\u201d Chomanika said in Nsanje when he visited the district during his familiarisation tour.\n\nThe visit took him the Matandwe Forest Reserve where the Shire Valley Transformation Programme (SVTP) is implementing natural resource management interventions.\n\nThe forest reserve is a habitat for Jateorhiza palmata, the scientific name for a climbing plant locally known as \u2018Thabalaba\u2019 whose root tuber is highly sought after for its medicinal properties.\n\nThe cassava-like tuber has a bitter taste. It is said to be useful for numerous ailments, including treatment of fever, diarrhoea, rheumatism, and relieving vomiting and nausea.\n\nIn addition, while there is no proven scientific evidence yet, locals say the tuber also enhances a man\u2019s sexual potency.\n\nIt is also believed that anti-venom for snake bites can be made from the tuber.\n\nThe plant is native to tropical southeastern Africa and present in Malawi, Tanzania, Mozambique and Zimbabwe.\n\nVendors from distant places flock to Nsanje to buy the root tuber, but offer very low prices.\n\nThrough the SVTP intervention, communities are now aware of the procedures they have to follow for them to achieve fair trade of the tuber using the Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) guidelines.\n\nThe government developed the ABS guidelines in 2021 to ensure fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from utilisation of genetic resources.\n\nSpeaking when he addressed district council members, Chomanika described Thabalaba as Malawi\u2019s \u2018real gold\u2019.\n\nHe spoke of the need to domesticate the plant to empower locals economically and save the Matandwe Forest Reserve from depletion.\n\nHe said government has instituted a research to see if the plant could be domesticated.\n\nIn January 2024, the Department of Environmental Affairs established 10 community research plots in Zunde, Mpatsa, and Magoti Extension Planning Areas (EPAs) in Nsanje.\n\nThe SVTP is financially supporting the study.\n\nOf the 10 plots, seven are functioning and were harvested in December 2024. The failure of the three has been attributed to management issues.\n\nChomanika urged researchers in local universities to get involved and conduct further analytical studies about the plant.\n\nHe decried the exploitation of locals by unscrupulous buyers who offer low prices, capitalising on the sellers\u2019 ignorance of its high monetary value when sold overseas.\n\n\u201cWhat we need now as government together with other stakeholders is to do a proper market research and link the local seller to the [foreign] buyer, taking out the middleman,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the middleman had to be removed if \u2018Thabalaba\u2019 was to make a positive impact on the locals.\n\nSVTP Deputy Project Coordinator, Limbani Gomani, pledged the programme\u2019s support to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Climate Change in its conservation efforts in the Shire Valley.\n\nGomani said that \u2018Thabalaba\u2019 was linked to the SVTP because \u201cit\u2019s an integral part of component 4 of the project that deals with natural resource management.\u201d\n\n\u201cIrrigation alone on its own may not be sustainable without conserving the environment,\u201d he said.\n\nThe SVTP is an ambitious, multibillion kwacha flagship project of the government that aims to transform the Shire Valley into an economic hub through commercial farming, using irrigation.\n\nThe Department of Irrigation in the Ministry of Agriculture is implementing the programme. Other implementing partners include other government ministries and departments.\n\nThe Malawi Government, World Bank, African Development Bank, and Opec Fund for International Development are financing the SVTP.\n\nThe SVTP will irrigate 43,370 hectares of land by abstracting water from the Shire River at Kapichira Dam and conveying it to the irrigable areas in Chikwawa and Nsanje through canals.\n\nThe objective of the programme is to transform subsistence smallholder farmers into commercial ones. The SVTP is expected to benefit 223,000 people in 48,400 households in the two districts.\n\nConstruction of the 118-kilometre irrigation canal from Kapichira Dam in Chikwawa to Bangula in Nsanje is currently underway.\n\nGomani said government decided to introduce natural resources interventions in the project\u2019s catchment area to conserve water, the main resource needed for irrigation farming.\n\n\u201cTo promote conservation in the catchment, the project decided to enhance livelihoods of people surrounding the SVTP irrigation area by promoting natural resources management interventions, including the cultivation of Thabalaba,\u201d he said.\n\nGomani said: \u201cThabalaba is very marketable and will improve people\u2019s livelihoods.

Malawi should promote it,\u201d said Mponya, Principal Research Scientist at the Malawi Plant Genetic Resources Centre in the Department of Agricultural Research Services.\n\nShe said the Thabalaba population in Nsanje had declined from 16 plants per hectare to 13 per hectare. This means that the plant is still under threat, hence the need to domesticate it.\n\nIf the domestication research proves a success, the Thabalaba plants growing in the wild would be used for back up only.\n\nAs of 2016, 60 metric tonnes of dried Thabalaba were being traded annually in Malawi, with the tonnage translating to 1138 hectares of conservation land, according to Mponya.\n\nMponya said: \u201cSo with the nature of Thabalaba, the quick way to realise this tonnage is through promoting cultivation, hence the need to conduct domestication research.\u201d\n\n\u201cPreliminary results of Thabalaba domestication indicate that it can be domesticated and planted as a crop. It takes about 11 months to harvest.\u201d\n\nMponya in her speech echoed the Minister\u2019s sentiments, saying that while they were doing their research on Thabalaba, the country\u2019s universities should also do their part.\n\nNsanje District Council Chairperson, Hussein Ngwali, said Thabalaba could be the solution to the problem of shortage of foreign exchange Malawi was grappling with.\n\n\u201cIf we do well growing Thabalaba, we will solve the issue of forex,\u201d Ngwali said.", "summary": "APPRECIATION\u2014Chomanika (in cap) appreciates how the tuber looks (on display)\nBy Gospel Mwalwanda: \n\n\n\u2018Thabalaba\u2019 is Malawi\u2019s \u2018real gold\u2019 with potentially huge economic benefits for the country, says the Minister of Natural Resources and Climate Change, Owen Chomanika.\n\n\nAccording to Chomanika, the tuber is an important plant that should be grown at household level to improve people\u2019s lives.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very profitable.

begs serious questions about the authorities\u2019 management of the crisis.\n\nIf forex truly is available, why has it not been made accessible to those who need it most until now?\n\nWhy has it taken so long for the government to take any meaningful action to address the forex crisis?\n\nThe sudden promise of forex availability for second-hand clothes importers appears more like a desperate attempt to placate the masses, rather than a genuine attempt to solve the underlying economic issues.\n\nThe reality is that the crisis facing Malawi is much more complex and the government\u2019s response has been insufficient.\n\nIf there were forex in the country that could have helped cushion the crisis earlier, why has it not been made available to reduce the soaring costs of living?\n\nThe fact that this forex is only now being \u201cdiscovered\u201d is indicative of either gross incompetence or intentional delay, neither of which inspire confidence in the government\u2019s ability to effectively tackle the crisis.\n\nMoreover, one cannot ignore the fact that government ministers and high-ranking officials continue to travel abroad with apparent ease, despite the forex shortages.\n\nIf forex truly is in short supply, where do these officials get the currency to fund their seemingly endless foreign trips?\n\nThe fact that government figures can afford these lavish travels while the general public struggles with skyrocketing commodity prices only serves to deepen the sense of inequality and mistrust.\n\nThis discrepancy highlights a double standard, where the elite have access to forex, while ordinary citizens suffer.\n\nWhen a nation faces such severe economic difficulties, it is imperative that its leadership takes drastic, decisive action.\n\nYet, despite the severity of the situation, the government seems unwilling to make the tough decisions needed to bring the country out of its economic slump.\n\nOne such action that could immediately help mitigate the forex crisis would be to implement a total ban on foreign travel for government officials.\n\nThis would not only preserve the limited forex that is available, but it would also demonstrate to the public that the government is serious about prioritising the needs of its citizens over personal luxury.\n\nThe forex that would have been spent on foreign trips could instead be used to secure essential imports which the country desperately needs.\n\nThe economic crisis is not just about the shortage of forex; it is a symptom of deeper systemic problems within Malawi\u2019s economy, which the government has consistently failed to address.\n\nThe fact that government officials continue to travel abroad while ordinary Malawians suffer speaks to a leadership that is disconnected from the realities on the ground.\n\nIf the government is serious about addressing the crisis, it needs to look at its own priorities and make sacrifices, just as the rest of the population has been forced to do.\n\nWhat we are witnessing today is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nWhile the vendors protesting on the streets may be the most visible manifestation of the public\u2019s frustration, they are not the only ones feeling the effects of the economic crisis.\n\nThe soaring prices of basic goods, the rising cost of living and the general decline in purchasing power are impacting the entire population.\n\nThe vendors who have taken to the streets may have sparked a protest movement, but the situation will only escalate as the crisis deepens.\n\nIt is only a matter of time before the larger population, which is also feeling the pressure, will no longer be able to ignore the economic hardship they face.\n\nMalawi is sitting on a ticking time bomb.\n\nIf the government fails to act decisively and swiftly to address the economic crisis, it risks plunging the country into a state of ungovernability.\n\nThe longer the government ignores the mounting frustration and suffering of the people, the more likely it is that widespread protests will erupt, potentially spiralling into something far more chaotic and uncontrollable.\n\nThe country cannot afford to wait until the situation becomes even more dire.\n\nThe economic crisis is already at a breaking point and the government must act before it is too late.\n\nIt is not just the poor or the vendors who are struggling; everyone in the country is feeling the pressure.\n\nFrom the middle class to the most vulnerable, the economic difficulties are becoming impossible to ignore.", "summary":

At 11.6\u00b0C, it had been the warmest February since 2017, when the average was slightly higher at 11.7\u00b0C.The heat had peaked on February 27, when the minimum temperature touched 19.5\u00b0C, the highest for the month in 74 years, since 1950. Meanwhile, the mean maximum temperature had stood at 26.7\u00b0C, the highest in two years. In comparison, February 2023 had seen an even higher average at 28.2\u00b0C, which had been the warmest in 17 years.Why had February been so warm?According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), this unusual warmth had been due to mostly clear skies and low rainfall. \u201cFebruary had remained mostly dry and warm as the winds kept varying, and despite some western disturbances, the rainfall had not been significant. The skies had been mostly clear,\u201d an IMD official.Rainfall had been significantly below normal, with only 1.4mm recorded throughout the month, 93% less than the expected 21.3mm. In contrast, February 2024 had seen much higher rainfall at 32.5mm.Air quality: Not as clean as it seemedWhile February had recorded the lowest average Air Quality Index (AQI) since 2016 at 214.2, experts had warned that pollution levels had remained dangerous.\u201cDespite a noticeable drop in the monthly average concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 compared to the previous year, pollution levels had still been nearly double the daily national air quality standards.

But this time, the blunder has hit closer to home, literally. In a shocking oversight, the university misspelt its own name as \u2018University of Mumabai\u2019 on the convocation certificates of the 2023-24 graduating batch. These error-ridden certificates have already reached several affiliated colleges, leaving students and faculty embarrassed.A Costly MistakeMany colleges have either returned the certificates or are in the process of doing so.

However, it remains unclear how many degrees were printed with the typo before the mistake was caught.A TOI report quoted a principal saying, \u201cThis was definitely not expected from the university.

The US president also commented about the chaotic meeting which ended abruptly after White House officials reportedly asked Zelenskyy to leave where he said that the Ukrainian leader was never serious about making peace or ending the war.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine just over three-years ago. Much of the west, including the US, jumped to Ukraine\u2019s defence, committing to helping the eastern European country fight Moscow\u2019s aggression through financial and military aid.Trump who returned to the White House in January has sought to reshape US foreign policy dramatically, among them, Washington\u2019s stance on Ukraine. Trump has been critical of the war in Ukraine for some time, and has been threatening to end support for Kyiv even before taking office.Tensions spiked last week after Trump and Zelenskyy exchange blows publicly, with Zelenskyy accusing Trump of living in a Russian-made \u201cdisinformation space\u201d, and Trump calling the Ukrainian president a dictator.The meeting was seen by many as an opportunity to calm tensions and bring some stability to an increasingly concerning global security situation, but it failed to achieve that.Zelenskyy described the contentious spat with Trump as \u201cnot good for both sides\u201d. He made the remarks during an exclusive interview to Fox News just hours after the heated incident.\"I'm very thankful to Americans for all your support. You did a lot. I'm thankful to President Trump and to Congress bipartisan support. And I was always very thankful from all our people. You helped us a lot from the very beginning during three years of full-scale innovation. You helped us to survive,\" said Zelenskyy on Bret Baier\u2019s \u2018Special Report\u2019 segment.Zelenskyy seemingly dismissed indications that Kyiv does not want to secure a peace deal, explaining what Ukrainians have had to endure for the last few years.\u201cNobody wants to finish (the war) more than we because we in Ukraine, we are in this war. We are in this battle, a battle for full freedom, for our lives.\u201dZelenskyy also urged Trump to reconsider his stance, and be on the right side, standing next to Ukrainians as they fight for western values, unity and security.\u201cI'm just telling that I think that we have to be on the same side. And I hope that the president on our side together with us. And that is very important to stop Putin. And I heard from President Trump a lot of times that he will stop the war, and I hope he will,\" added Zelenskyy.Zelenskyy insists that ending the suffering of Ukrainians must come with guarantees to prevent this from happening again.\u201cYou know, just a ceasefire without security guarantees, this so sensitive for our people. I'm speaking like a president of a people who are in this struggle three years,\u201d said Zelenskyy.\u201cthey just want to hear that America (is) on our side and that America will stay with us, not with Russians. With us. That's it. But I'm sure that it will be.\u201dZelenskyy also noted that the minerals deal, which was on Friday\u2019s agenda but was suspended after the meeting went sour, will be the first step towards obtaining the security guarantees Kyiv deems necessary.\u201cThe deal on minerals is the first step to security guarantees.

Compared to pre-pandemic levels, Italy and Spain have shown the strongest increase, whereas job postings in the UK remain below February 2020 levels.According to data from the hiring platform Indeed, job postings in Italy and Spain rose by 9% and 4%, respectively, on a seasonally adjusted basis in the three months leading up to February 14, 2025. In contrast, job postings declined in France (4%), Germany (2%), and the UK (2%) over the same period.Examining these trends over the past six months and since the start of 2025 (as of 14 February), a similar pattern emerges, despite variations in the figures. One constant remains: job postings in Spain and Italy continue to rise, while Germany, the UK, and France show a downward trend.\"Italy and Spain are bucking the continued slowdown in hiring that we're seeing in many large European economies. Rising job posting levels are a positive sign for these labour markets,\" Pawel Adrjan, Director of Economic Research at Indeed, told Euronews Business. What's behind these trends?As to the possible reasons for these trends, Pawel Adrjan explained that Italy and Spain have benefitted from the Next Generation EU funds and from growth in service exports, with Spain's GDP growth additionally getting a boost from population growth through immigration. While employment and GDP growth in Italy slowed in 2024, hiring is benefitting from a moderate growth outlook for 2025 driven by household consumption and potential for a further boost from the EU funds. \"Both labour markets remain tighter than historically\", he added. Which sectors are driving the growth?According to Indeed, the two occupational categories that contributed the most to the rise in job postings in Italy and Spain in the three months to 14 February 2025 were Food Preparation & Service and Software Development.As to the declining trends in the other three countries, Adrjan said: \"Structural headwinds, such as stagnant manufacturing and economic uncertainty, have slowed hiring in the UK, Germany, and France.\" What are the expectations for 2025 in these countries?Rising job postings suggest that employment will continue to rise in Italy and Spain in 2025 unless there is any negative impact from geopolitical and trade tensions that might impact the EU economy according to Adrjan. \"Both labour markets remain tight, as measured by the ratio of job vacancies to unemployment, leading to solid wage growth that keeps attracting people to the labour market\", he said.In contrast, the UK, Germany and France are likely to experience little job growth if broader economic growth does not pick up significantly. \"In fact, tax data from the UK shows that payroll employment is down in the past six months, despite the latest reading from January pointing to a partial recovery\", Pawel Adrjan noted. The UK stands out as an outlier compared to early 2020Among the five countries, the UK stands out as an outlier compared to the pre-pandemic benchmark of 1February, 2020, when job postings were indexed at 100. As of mid-February 2025, the UK is the only country where this index remains below 100, standing at 85.1, indicating a decline compared to five years ago.\"Because employers have been cautious for some time amid lingering economic uncertainty, high interest rates, and weak GDP growth. This has been especially pronounced in higher-skilled, professional occupations\", Adrjan said, explaining this trend.According to him, while the fall in the job postings index below its pre-pandemic level predates the latest Autumn Budget, the announced increases in firms' costs related to national insurance and minimum wages further increased caution among employers with respect to hiring for 2025.Job postings in Italy and Spain are 78% and 52% above their pre-pandemic levels, respectively. In this period, France has seen a 29% increase, while Germany is up by 26%.Online job postings have become an increasingly important indicator for analysing job market trends, particularly for real-time insights. Some statistics offices, including the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS), have begun using online job advertisement indices as part of their experimental statistics.Actual employment ratesOn the other hand, Italy (67.4%) and Spain (71.4%) recorded the lowest employment rates among these countries in the third quarter of 2024, according to Eurostat and the ONS. Germany (81.2) had the highest employment rate, followed by France (75.3%) and the UK (74.9%).Of course, while this is a different indicator than job postings and the latest available data is from the third quarter of 2024, it still provides valuable insight into overall employment trends.Despite being the lowest among them, Italy's rate is at its highest in recent years.", "summary": "Based on job postings from the hiring platform Indeed, Euronews Business analyses 2025's job market trends across Europe's five largest economies.", "url": "https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/03/01/job-trends-why-are-italy-and-spain-hiring-while-the-uk-germany-and-france-slow", "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/08/08/38/1440x810_cmsv2_bda8c9dd-472e-51d3-b540-49d4c0b10b65-9080838.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:07:52", "author": "Servet Yanatma", "authors": ["Servet Yanatma"], "language": "en", "source_country": "fr", "sentiment": 0.004}, {"id": 295541332, "title": "Brussels, my love?

The 7-footer who anchored the 76ers' laborious rebuilding plan known as the Process sure flashed his dominance at times through his injury-riddled career.\nHe dropped 70 points. Won an MVP and two scoring titles. He was a five-time All-NBA selection.\nYet, the ultimate stamp on Embiid's career \u2014 nine years active, two more entirely sidelined, all with Philadelphia \u2014 are the laundry list of injuries, the games missed, the countless health updates, that have defined and depreciated his career.\nThe latest, a left knee injury that never returned to form following surgery last season, will ultimately cost him the stretch run of this one.\nThe 76ers made the inevitable a reality on Friday, Feb. 28, when they shut down Embiid for the rest of the season, saying he is \u201cmedically unable to play\u201d and will focus on treatment and rehabilitation of his left knee.\nIt's a sad, familiar refrain for one of the most talented, personable big men of his time.\nCounting the 164 games he missed his first two seasons after he was drafted No. 3 overall in 2014 and what's left of this season, Embiid will have played in 452 of 883 76ers' games by the end of this season \u2014 missing nearly 50% of the regular season.\n\u201cThe Philadelphia 76ers and Joel Embiid have been consulting with top specialists regarding ongoing issues with his left knee. After further evaluation, it has been determined that he is medically unable to play and will miss the remainder of the season to focus on treatment and rehabilitation,\u201d the team said in a statement.\n\u201cWe are working with medical experts to determine the exact treatment plan and will update media when we have more information. The team and specialists will continue working with Joel to ensure the best path forward for his long-term health and performance.\u201d\nThere are, of course, no guarantees Embiid will ever play again for the 76ers \u2014 an option that might not be decided until deep into the offseason.\nOne of the preseason favorites to contend for an NBA title, the Sixers take a nine-game losing streak into Saturday's game against the Warriors. Even with the heavy slide, the Sixers were just 2 1/2 games out of a spot in the play-in tournament entering Friday's games.\nEmbiid will miss his third straight game overall and hasn\u2019t played since he was benched for ineffectiveness in the fourth quarter of a loss last Saturday to Brooklyn.\nThe 76ers are 8-11 with Embiid this season; 12-27 without him.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any goals other than we\u2019re playing to win and we\u2019re playing to play better,\u201d 76ers coach Nick Nurse said Friday. \u201cI\u2019ve just been trying to concentrate on the team and the doctors have been trying to figure out what\u2019s best for Joel, and then we\u2019ll figure it out from there.\u201d\nEmbiid has been hobbled by injuries all season, and served a three-game suspension for shoving a member of the media. He\u2019s averaged 23.8 points \u2014 he averaged at least 30 and won two scoring titles the last three seasons \u2014 and scored only 29 points combined in his last two games.\nEmbiid acknowledged earlier this month he may have to undergo another surgery on the left knee.\n\u201cI think the straightforward answer is that when you\u2019ve got something that\u2019s inconsistent, at some point, you\u2019ve got to do something about it,\u201d Embiid said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what it is. We\u2019re looking into every option.\u201d\nHe played just 39 games last season due to a torn meniscus in his left knee. The 76ers announced in early February of that season that he had undergone surgery. Embiid came back in early April, was part of the 76ers\u2019 playoff run, and then won a gold medal with the U.S. Olympic team last year at the Paris Games.\nEmbiid has played only 58 regular-season games and seven play-in tournament/playoff games since he earned NBA MVP honors in the 2022-23 season.\n\u201cThe way I was playing a year ago is not the way I\u2019m playing right now,\u201d Embiid said last week after the 76ers lost to Boston. \u201cI probably need to fix the problem, and then I\u2019ll be back at that level. But it\u2019s hard to have trust when you\u2019re not yourself.\u201d\nThe 76ers\u2019 first-round pick is top-six protected or else it goes to the Oklahoma City Thunder, one reason there was speculation the Sixers might shut down Embiid and cut their losses on the season.\nThe poster child for load management, Embiid has injured nearly every part of his body since even before he entered the NBA.

Gene was not only a legendary actor whose talent shaped generations of storytelling, but he and Betsy were also longtime residents of our community, deeply woven into the fabric of Santa Fe,\u201d LaBar-Tapia said. \u201cGene\u2019s legacy in film is unparalleled, spanning decades of unforgettable performances, including some that are filmed right here in Santa Fe. His work inspired countless artists, actors and filmmakers, and his impact will continue to be felt for generations to come.\u201d \n\nShe continued, \u201cBut beyond Hollywood, Gene and Betsy were our neighbors who embrace the Santa Fe lifestyle and embraced Santa Fe as their home. Their kindness, generosity and love for this city made them more than just icons, they were a part of our family. Our thoughts are with their loved ones and all who knew them and admired them. We join the film industry, their family, their friends and all the people of Santa Fe in honoring their memory.\u201d\n\nThe primary reason for Friday\u2019s press conference was for Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza to update the public on what they had learned since Hackman and Arakawa\u2019s bodies were found on Wednesday, Feb. 26. Namely, that the \u201clast event\u201d on Hackman\u2019s pacemaker was recorded back on Feb. 17 \u2013 nine days before the couple was discovered.\n\n\u201cBoth individuals tested negative for carbon monoxide. An initial interrogation was conducted of Mr. Hackman\u2019s pacemaker. This revealed that his last event was recorded on Feb. 17, 2025,\u201d Mendoza said, citing the pathologist from the New Mexico office of the medical investigator. \u201cInitial findings noted no external trauma to either individual. The manner and cause of death has not been determined.

He\u2019s nominated again this year for \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d and so is Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who might become the only other male actor under thirty to score the prize for his portrayal of Bob Dylan in \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d\n\nIn Hollywood, it\u2019s not uncommon for actresses, including Marlee Matlin, Jennifer Lawrence and Audrey Hepburn to win in their 20s, but leading such as Paul Newman, Al Pacino and Brad Pitt had to wait until much later in their career to finally take home the gold statuette. \n\nHere are the 10 Youngest Best Actor winners in Oscar history. (Note: The year listed is when the Oscar was awarded, not when the film was released.)\n\n9. Clark Gable, 34 years, 26 days, \u201cIt Happened One Night\u201d (1935)\n\nGable\u2019s win for the Frank Capra romantic comedy was part of a historic sweep of the top categories: Best Actor, Best Director, Best Picture, Best Actress (Claudette Colbert), and Best Adapted Screenplay. He held the record for youngest winner in the category for six years. Five years later he was nominated again for his most famous role as Rhett Butler in \u201cGone With the Wind,\u201d but was not one of the film\u2019s eight Oscar wins. \n\n8. Eddie Redmayne, 33 years, 47 days, \u201cThe Theory of Everything\u201d (2015)\n\nAt the 87th Oscars, Redmayne collected the trophy for his portrayal of astrophysicist Stephen Hawking in \u201cThe Theory of Everything.\u201d He was nominated again the following year for \u201cThe Danish Girl,\u201d but lost to Leonardo DiCaprio in \u201cThe Revenant.\u201d \n\n7. Daniel Day-Lewis, 32 years, 331 days, \u201cMy Left Foot\u201d (1990)\n\nThe now-retired acting legend won the first of his three Best Actor Oscars in 1990 for his portrayal of Christy Brown in \u201cMy Left Foot.\u201d He followed that up with a statuette for 2007\u2019s \u201cThere Will Be Blood\u201d and for playing Abraham Lincoln in Spielberg\u2019s 2012 biopic.\n\n6. James Stewart, 32 years, 283 days, \u201cThe Philadelphia Story\u201d (1941)\n\nStewart\u2019s role in \u201cThe Philadelphia Story\u201d was really more supporting, but many consider this win to be retroactive for his lead performance the year before in Frank Capra\u2019s \u201cMr. Smith Goes to Washington.\u201d He held record for 14 years until 1955. Ginger Rogers, who costarred with Stewart in \u201cVivacious Lady,\u201d won Best Actress that year for \u201cKitty Foyle.\u201d\n\n5. Nicolas Cage, 32 years, 78 days, \u201cLeaving Las Vegas\u201d (1996)\n\nDespite coming from a showbiz family \u2014 his uncle is Francis Ford Coppola \u2014 Cage carved out his own path as an intense, chameleon-like performer in often quirky roles such as \u201cVampire\u2019s Kiss\u201d and \u201cRaising Arizona.\u201d He won the Oscar with his first nomination, a role in which he played a hopeless alcoholic. He was nominated again for his dual role in 2002\u2019s \u201cAdaptation.\u201d\n\n4. Maximilian Schell, 31 years, 122 days, \u201cJudgment at Nuremberg\u201d (1962)\n\nThe Swiss actor, who was born in Austria, was brilliant as an attorney who ruthlessly interrogates Holocaust survivors played by Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift in Stanley Kramer\u2019s drama about the Nuremberg trials of 1947. He beat out his \u201cJudgment at Nuremberg\u201d costar Spencer Tracy and Paul Newman in his third acting nomination (out of an eventual 9) for \u201cHud.\u201d \n\n3. Marlon Brando, 30 years, 361 days, \u201cOn the Waterfront\u201d (1955)\n\nBrando won the first of his two Oscars for his role as former boxer Terry Molloy, who \u201ccoulda been somebody,\u201d until a mob boss convinced him to throw a fight. He attended the 1955 ceremony in person, but famously sent Sacheen Littlefeather to accept in his place when he won Best Actor for \u201cThe Godfather\u201d in 1973. He was the youngest winner in the category for 23 years, until Richard Dreyfuss in 1978.\n\n2. Richard Dreyfuss, 30 years, 156 days, \u201cThe Goodbye Girl\u201d (1978)\n\nThe \u201cJaws\u201d star set a new record when he was named Best Actor on April 3, 1978. In the Herbert Ross film, he played struggling off-Broadway actor Elliot Garfield who finds romance with the single mom (Marsha Mason) whose room he\u2019s renting. Mason was nominated for Best Actress while Quinn Cummings, who played her daughter, became one of the youngest Best Supporting Actress nominees at 10 and a half.\n\n1. Adrien Brody, 29 years, 343 days, \u201cThe Pianist\u201d (2003)\n\nBrody has held the record as the youngest Best Actor winner for 21 years. He played pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman in the 2002 biopic from Roman Polanski, who also won a Best Director Oscar. Brody\u2019s nominated again for Brady Corbet\u2019s \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d in which he stars as L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th, an emigr\u00e9 architect who survived the Holocaust.", "summary": "James Stewart and Nicolas Cage are also on the list\n\n\nThe post Youngest Best Actor Oscar Winners From Adrien Brody to Marlon Brando | Photos appeared first on TheWrap.", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/youngest-best-actor-oscar-winners-adrien-brody-photos/", "image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/youngest-best-actor-winners.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 04:03:42", "author": "Sharon Knolle", "authors": ["Sharon Knolle"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.673}, {"id": 295551064, "title": "LA Times\u2019 De Los Editor Resigns, Accuses Leadership of Dismissing HR Complaints Against Managing Editor | Exclusive", "text": "As over 40 veteran staffers left the Los Angeles Times via a mass buyout on Friday, one more longtime journalist unexpectedly joined the exodus: De Los assistant editor and reporter Paloma Esquivel resigned after 17 years with the paper, citing management\u2019s alleged failure to address longstanding HR complaints against managing editor Hector Becerra.\n\nEsquivel, who was on the paper\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning writing teams in 2011 and 2016, announced her resignation on a company Slack channel Friday, screenshots of which were obtained exclusively by TheWrap. She also included full text of a Feb. 3 letter she said was sent to HR manager Maya Dotson and Executive Editor Terry Tang regarding Becerra\u2019s \u201cinappropriate, highly personal and baseless assessments of his co-workers\u2019 talent levels, work ethic, productivity and collegiality.\u201d She also said in her letter such disparagement was exclusive to \u201cwomen and staffers of color.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn Feb. 3, I sent the letter that\u2019s below to Terry. I never got a response. This is why, after 17 years of investing myself in the L.A. Times and despite how much I truly love my job as an editor with De Los, I\u2019m leaving the L.A. Times today,\u201d Esquivel wrote.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sharing the letter here now with the hope of a journalist who has always believed that shedding light is sometimes the only way to bring change,\u201d she continued. \u201cI don\u2019t want those of you who remain to have to continue dealing with what too many of us have already had to deal with. My hope for the L.A. Times is that it can one day be a place where workers feel respected and valued and where they can do their work knowing that those in positions of power won\u2019t berate or disparage them. Our work is a service to our community. It deserves better.\u201d\n\nEsquivel\u2019s access to the Times\u2019 Slack channels was revoked soon after she sent the notice, TheWrap has learned. \n\nView screenshots from her correspondence below:\n\nEsquivel then attached a copy of the lengthy Feb. 3 letter she said was sent Feb. 3 to Dotson and Tang. \n\nThe letter detailed several instances when Becerra allegedly mistreated employees, mostly women and people of color, including a 2022 joint staff complaint that cited his \u201cinappropriate, highly personal, and baseless assessments of his co-workers\u2019 talent levels, work ethic, productivity, and collegiality.\u201d\n\nEsquivel quoted from the complaint: \u201cBecerra has demonstrated a pattern of both insulting his colleagues directly and disparaging them to others in the newsroom.\u201d\n\nThe most recent incident Esquivel mentioned was from January of this year. In response to a message she had written on the company Slack questioning the paper\u2019s editorial decision making under Becerra, Tang and billionaire owner Patrick Soon-Shiong, Becerra allegedly called Esquivel to shout and \u201cberate\u201d her, she said.\n\n\u201cHe went on shouting for several minutes, telling me that I didn\u2019t understand the kind of pressure managers are under, that Patrick [Soon-Shiong] is the owner of the paper and that if people don\u2019t like it they don\u2019t need to work here. I eventually told him that it was inappropriate for him to shout at me and told him that perhaps he should call me back when we could have a professional conversation,\u201d she wrote.\n\nInstead, Esquivel alleged, the managing editor told her she was not writing enough stories while a reporter and that \u201cothers in the newsroom agreed with him \u2026 These comments about my job performance seemed aimed not at addressing any of the issues he said he was calling about, but at making me feel diminished.\u201d\n\nShe also mentioned a writer who resigned in 2022 because of similar \u201cdisparaging behavior\u201d from Becerra and ended the letter with, \u201cI want to know whether the company is going to do anything to put a stop to this.\u201d\n\nNancy V. Antoniou, Chief Human Resources Officer, responded to Esquivel\u2019s Slack message on Friday, saying that the company \u201ctakes employee relations matters seriously\u201d and that posting about it a public channel is \u201cnot appropriate.\u201d\n\nAntoniou added, \u201cThe assertion that the company has ignored claims of abuse or hostility towards our employees is false.\u201d She maintained that the company had addressed the complaints in the post and that Esquivel\u2019s concerns should remain a \u201cconfidential matter.\u201d\n\nAlso on Friday, Tang separately emailed the newsroom to address the departing staffers \u2014 which you can read in the embedded image above. The email did not address Esquivel\u2019s concerns, but merely said, \u201cI know it\u2019s an emotional day for all of us, as we say farewell to so many valued friends.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to TheWrap, Maria L. La Ganga, L.A. Times\u2019 deputy managing editor for California and Metro, defended Becerra for his track record of \u201cinclusivity,\u201d calling Esquivel\u2019s assertions against him \u201csadly and blatantly wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cHector Becerra has a record of inclusivity and support for journalists of color that has been recognized throughout the industry,\u201d Ganga said. \u201cHe created the most diverse, most inclusive and strongest Metro desk in the paper\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nIn a separate statement, a spokesperson for the L.A. Times told TheWrap, \u201cWe generally do not comment on personnel matters. However, we\u2019d like to be clear that any assertion that the company has ignored claims of abuse or hostility towards our employees is false.\u201d", "summary": "In a message on the Times' internal Slack Friday, Paloma Esquivel says she hopes the newsroom becomes a place where journalists \"can do their work knowing that those in positions of power won\u2019t berate or disparage them\"\n\n\nThe post LA Times&#8217; De Los Editor Resigns, Accuses Leadership of Dismissing HR Complaints Against Managing Editor | Exclusive appeared first on TheWrap.", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/la-times-de-los-editor-paloma-esquivel-hector-becerra-hr-complaints/", "image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/LA-Times-managing-editor-hector-becerra-buyout.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 02:20:33", "author": "Sharon Knolle", "authors": ["Sharon Knolle"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.267}, {"id": 295551060, "title": "Golden Globes Puts an Abrupt End to $75,000 Salaries for HFPA Voters", "text": "The Golden Globes organization announced Friday it would no longer pay the $75,000 annual salary awarded to former Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) members, the group who votes on the yearly film and TV award winners TheWrap has learned. \n\nGolden Globes president Helen Hoehne shared the news in a special Zoom meeting on Friday, Feb. 28 to some 50 voting members.

The change to stop paying voters matches other major award processes including the Oscars, Emmys and Grammys, who all have members vote pro bono. \n\nAccording to THR\u2019s report, a spokesperson for the Golden Globes said the policy change was \u201can acknowledgement that continuing to pay members could add to a perception of bias in voting.\u201d The rep also said that the severance package was in line with the contractual obligations the company was responsible for.\n\nIn 2021, the Golden Globes faced severe criticism after a bombshell Los Angeles Times investigation revealed the HFPA had no Black members. The organization was met with immediate backlash from prominent members of Hollywood including \u201cSelma\u201d director Ava DuVernay and powerhouse TV producer Shonda Rhimes, among others. The hashtag #TimesUpGlobes began trending and led to sweeping changes for the Globes. \n\nOne major change to the awards was the ownership. The HFPA was once nonprofit but is now the for-profit Golden Globes LLC and owned by Penske Media Corporation. The voting body also expanded from 87 members to over 300 members across 85 different countries. The 50 former members of HFPA now make up a small subset of the total voting body. \n\nThe Hollywood Reporter was first to break the news.", "summary": "The move cancels a five year deal struck in 2023 and affects some 50 members\n\n\nThe post Golden Globes Puts an Abrupt End to $75,000 Salaries for HFPA Voters appeared first on TheWrap.", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/golden-globes-ends-voter-salaries-hfpa-members/", "image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092322-Golden-Globes-Atwork.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 02:45:00", "author": "Daren Defrank", "authors": ["Daren Defrank"], "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.278}, {"id": 295551062, "title": "\u2018My Dead Friend Zoe\u2019 Review: Good Intentions Are Enough in This Sensitive PTSD Drama", "text": "I\u2019m going to start today by asking for a show of hands. Who here has seen a film where the twist ending was one of the characters was secretly dead the whole time? OK, keep them up. One, two \u2014 hey you on your phone, are you raising your hand or saying hi to somebody? OK, that\u2019s three \u2026 roughly three hundred million! Great! \n\n\u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d is not one of those movies. Kyle Hausmann-Stokes\u2019 debut feature stars Sonequa Martin-Green (\u201cStar Trek: Discovery\u201d) as Merit, an Army veteran struggling with PTSD. Her best friend Zoe \u2014 spoiler alert for anyone who hasn\u2019t read the title \u2014 is dead, but still with Merit at all times. She\u2019s played by Natalie Morales (\u201cNo Hard Feelings\u201d) and despite the whole \u201cbeing dead\u201d thing she\u2019s actually quite lively, providing a running commentary on Merit\u2019s life and anxieties. \n\nThe film reveals Zoe is only in Merit\u2019s head during the first few scenes, because it\u2019s not about surprising the audience. (And considering how common that particular twist is, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise anyway.) It\u2019s about making us live with Merit\u2019s plight on a daily basis, understanding what she\u2019s running from and why she\u2019s running into the past, where all her regrets are. Hausmann-Stokes isn\u2019t screwing with us, he\u2019s being as direct as possible.\n\nMerit refuses to open up in group therapy, led by Dr. Cole (Morgan Freeman). Zoe doesn\u2019t want her to anyway. When Merit finds out her grandfather Dale (Ed Harris) is in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s, she packs up Zoe and drives to his lake house. Dale is a wonderful old man when he\u2019s not a curmudgeonly old fart, but his problems are spiraling out of his control and Merit, spiraling herself, isn\u2019t much of a caretaker. \n\nThere are lots of stories about the experiences of American veterans. Some of the more famous ones involve the search for brazen and violent catharsis. \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d is the sensitive, downplayed variety, a tender character piece about people and their complicated feelings. As directed by Hausmann-Stokes, who co-wrote the script with A.J. Bermudez, the film seems genuinely sensitive to the stories of its characters and anyone in the audience who can relate to their struggles.\n\nThe film also seems padded within an inch of its life, displaying the unmistakable plumage of a short film adapted to feature length long before you check Wikipedia and confirm that yes, indeed it was. The narrative has just enough incident to fill 15-20 minutes and yet it runs for 98 of them. Merit\u2019s relationship with Dr. Cole has a set-up and a payoff and nearly nothing in between. Her flashbacks to the war, when Zoe was still alive, hints at twists and reversals, or at least something that resembles external conflict, but that road leads to nowhere. Which is ultimately revealed to be the point, granted, but a long commute is a long commute no matter where you end up.\n\nThere are worse things a movie can be besides padded, and \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d isn\u2019t any of those things. Its heart is in the right place, its characters feel real (even when they\u2019re literally not), and for anyone to whom this story rings a bell, it\u2019s a tearjerker. Martin-Green excels at navigating emotional whirlpools and carries the film with dignity. Morales embodies a playful, jealous imp in Merit\u2019s brain and a complex, conflicted, extremely human being in the flashbacks. Harris, having no narrative contrivance to contend with, is simply exceptional as an old man realizing that he needs help, as much as it pains him and pisses him off.\n\n\u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d is a noble film, seemingly honest and open. It\u2019s not a terribly exciting one, and it struggles to justify its modest length, but plot isn\u2019t everything. It\u2019s a great way to engage the audience long enough to convey all your noble ideas, but Hausmann-Stokes\u2019 characters are almost fascinating enough on their own. Not quite, but almost. A great cast can take you far.

Zelinsky was in the Oval Office to discuss the big turnaround that the country has done, where Trump says now he\u2019s the dictator and Ukraine invaded Russia. Interesting\u2026 and it devolved into this shouting match, which, I\u2019m sure Trump thinks is good TV. You have to see it to believe it. So let\u2019s take a look at a little of this,\u201d Maher said.\n\nAt this point he played a short clip. To be clear, it wasn\u2019t a \u201cshouting match,\u201d it was a situation where Trump and Vance shouted at Zelenskyy, who did not shout back.\n\n\u201cAfterwards at a press conference a reporter asked Trump, \u2018Do you still believe that Zelinsky is the dictator,\u2019 and Trump said, \u2018Did I say that? I can\u2019t believe I said that. Also those tariffs, who ordered those tariffs?\u201d Maher joked. Then he changed topics to Elon Musk. \n\n\u201cThe problem we have is the man\u2026 who is running this country is hell bent on sowing chaos, and Trump is doing nothing to stop him,\u201d Maher joked, adding, \u201cElon, come back.

That started in late October when, just days before the 2024 election, Bezos killed a planned endorsement of Kamala Harris.\n\nIn the 24 hours after that announcement, the Washington Post lost a staggering 250,000 paid subscribers, at the time a 10% drop. By election day that drop had grown to more than 300,000 and the exodus continued into the new year. In fact, though the paper claims it has brought in 400,000 new subscribers in the months since the election thanks to an aggressive marketing push, according to NPR WaPo has still suffered a net loss of more than 200,000 subscriptions.\n\nThat may be because Bezos, apparently determined to destroy the reputation of the paper he bought for $250 million in 2013, has increasingly overruled editorial judgment and fostered a culture of apparent censorship of views contrary to his own since the election. \n\nFor instance, In January, Washington Post editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes quit after editors killed a satirical cartoon that mocked Bezos and other media and tech giants for their fealty to Donald Trump. And in early February, WaPo canceled a planned \u201cFire Elon\u201d advertisement.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bezos announced the Opinion section change to staff, asserting that \u201cwe are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets.\u201d Opposing views, Bezos said, will not be welcome at the Post. Of course, the terms were not defined, but the billionaire has indicated a clear, conservative interpretation of phrases like \u201cpersonal liberties.\u201d Make of that what you will.\n\nOpinion editor David Shipley quit in protest after this announcement, and multiple WaPo staffers and alums condemned the move. Meanwhile, it\u2019s only the latest curious example of billionaire businessmen who don\u2019t seem interested in whether or not a business is actually successful if said business is a newspaper that dare publish liberal points of view.

Unlike most external vibrators, the Legato is a ring vibrator engineered to stimulate the vulva\u2014not just the clitoris. This is an ideal sex toy for those seeking a penetration-free external vibrator that doesn\u2019t just offer direct clitoral stimulation. \n\nCreated by leading OB-GYNS and urologists, the beginner-friendly Legato is made of waterproof silicone, allowing the vibrator to bend and adapt to all vulva shapes and sizes. Its four strategically placed motors deliver mind-blowing pleasure to the entire vulva while enhancing natural lubrication. \n\nPlus, thanks to the flexible ring design, the Legato also excels at solo and partnered play. The wide circular gap in the middle allows a partner (or another sex toy) to penetrate. In fact, male partners may even reap the benefits of extra stimulation in certain positions like missionary. \n\nBut the fun for couples doesn\u2019t end there. By using the companion app, you or your partner can play with 16 vibration intensity settings.

I was right behind his appointment but I\u2019ll be the first to admit I did openly question some of the other calls made by the club\u2019s US owner as well as former CEO Ben Kensell. I wasn\u2019t the only one.\n\nI\u2019m sure we all remember Bill Foley\u2019s comments when hitting out in the wake of his Black Knight group being overruled on giving the job to Gray after Nick Montgomery\u2019s sacking. With Hibs toiling after a horrid start, it looked like fair comment. But Gordon will feel he can now, quite rightly, tell his doubters to f*** off. And I\u2019ll happily admit I was wrong about Gordon if Davie and his team can seal a remarkable turnaround to lead the club to third place.\n\nBut maybe only after I join the other naysayers in rushing to wipe those critical posts from my X account. I imagine Ian will have all the screenshots saved anyway so he can have a pop back. He\u2019ll be well within his rights to do so if Hibs can finish the season off strongly.\n\nThe Black Knight folk will certainly owe Gordon and big Malky Mackay \u2013 appointed sporting director last summer too \u2013 an apology if Hibs can pull this off. Publicly questioning the appointment of Gray was an appalling move \u2013 even if they were right to demand a bigger say in the running of the club having sunk \u00a36million in last summer.\n\nTalking of millions, it was great to see Gordon take accountability for the mistakes he has undoubtedly made by announcing his family will cover this year\u2019s \u00a37.2million losses. It must be great to have that kind of cash to throw around.\n\nIf Ian wants to take a look at my gas bill, he\u2019s more than welcome. But it\u2019s a move that will put a lot of Hibs fans\u2019 minds at ease amid fears of a growing debt pile.\n\nSupporters will always have that worry about what happens next if the owner decides to pull the plug. You only have to look back to what happened when Vladimir Romanov did just that across the city.\n\nBut Gordon has shown again that he is committed to Hibs, which is hugely reassuring. It will have been a costly lesson for the owners but perhaps it will teach Ian to be a bit more careful with his decision-making in future.\n\nThe situation Hibs have got themselves into, financially, is entirely self-inflicted and began with the decision to sack Jack Ross. Since then, it\u2019s been a catalogue of expensive mistakes. But hopefully things can perhaps start looking up now.\n\nWith life going so well on the pitch, the last thing Hibs need is off-field troubles to dampen the feel-good factor Gray\u2019s players are generating.\n\n The fans are right behind the team again \u2013 as you saw after last weekend\u2019s win over Celtic with that rendition of Sunshine on Leith. It\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve seen those kind of scenes at Easter Road and Davie will not want anything interfering with that, not with a huge game coming up on Sunday.\n\n I read my rival Record Sport columnist Ryan Stevenson write that this weekend\u2019s derby is the biggest in years. I don\u2019t often agree with what the former Jambo has to say but he\u2019s bang on this time. It\u2019s a key match for both clubs as they chase third and, for once, the two teams are coming in with confidence surging. \n\nNeil Critchley has done a great job getting Hearts going again, just as Gray has with his side. And there is a huge prize ahead for whichever team comes out on top.\n\nIf you can pip Aberdeen and Dundee United to third, you will be guaranteed group stage football if Celtic win the cup. They\u2019ll have a play-off game to reach the Europa League, with the safety net offering a route into the Conference.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen how much money clubs can make in these tournaments, which is why the four hopefuls will be doing all they can to snatch third. If you spend the cash wisely, you can go and put a stranglehold on that best-of-the-rest slot.\n\nBut right now, Hibs just need to concentrate on seeing off Hearts. The gap is four points but a win will take it to seven, which would be a massive advantage with 29 games played.\n\nThere\u2019s still a long way to go but I really feel Hibs are on the right track.\n\nThey\u2019ve got a real steeliness about them and it\u2019s been a long, long time since I\u2019ve be able to say that about a Hibs outfit. For me, they mirror their manager.\n\nAs a player, Davie was a hardy character with a good mentality. When Hibs went 1-0 down on Wednesday night to Dundee United, I was waiting for all those tweets about them \u201cHibsing it\u201d.\n\nBut maybe the critics had deleted them all by the time the full-time whistle had gone\u2026", "summary": "Tam was one of the naysayers as Hibs toiled but admits he's ready to do cover his social media tracks after easter Road revival", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ian-gordon-can-tell-hibs-34774177", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article33618641.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS342161094.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:00:00", "author": "Tam McManus", "authors": ["Tam McManus"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.199}, {"id": 295541604, "title": "Joe Shaughnessy adamant Dundee losing basement battle with St Johnstone will be no catastrophe as he paints relegation picture", "text": "Joe Shaughnessy will be doing everything to avoid it but doesn\u2019t think it would be catastrophic if Dundee were to lose their basement battle with St Johnstone .

That means getting back to basics. Shaughnessy stated: \u201cIt was going to be a big game, regardless of the result the other night. We were well aware before these three games how big they were. \u201cIt is important for us to turn round the form we have had. We\u2019ve had some poor results lately and we\u2019ve been dragged down into that battle. We are well aware that we need to turn it around at some point and tomorrow would be a good start. \u201cWe\u2019ve probably not done the basics well enough, as a collective. As defenders we\u2019ve given away poor goals and that is something we need to address. As a collective we need to address that, do the basics and our jobs and then hopefully it comes together.\u201d Shaughnessy is in no doubt his young squad has the mental toughness and the ability on the park to dig themselves out of trouble. \u201cI am fully confident that the players we have in the dressing room are well able for it,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWe are up for the fight and we\u2019ve shown we can get results. \u201cIt is about putting a performance together and showing how it means to all of us to get us out of the situation that we\u2019ve put ourselves in. Nobody is coming in to save us now. It is us now. \u201cIt is one of those, you lay down and let it happen or you get up and fight. I am confident the boys are up for that fight.\u201d Saints looked down and out but have reeled others back and Shaughnessy believes they deserve credit. He acknowledged: \u201cThey\u2019ve shown a bit of fight. They seemed pretty confident even when they were down the bottom. \u201cThey were still passing it well and playing good possession football. It is impressive what they have done but we want to go out there and we are at home and we want to put our own stamp on the game.\u201d Manager Tony Docherty has also played down the importance of a win. He said: \u201cYes, it is a big game but they are all big games at this stage in the season. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put any more emphasis on this than any other one.

Currently riding a 30-fight unbeaten streak, 30-year-old 'Tank' faces the 25-1-1 'Reaper' in an all-American showdown at Brooklyn's Barclays Center in the early hours of Sunday morning. Davis had made five defences of his title since winning it in 2019 via a 12th-round TKO over Yuriorkis Gamboa, sporting recent wins over the likes of Ryan Garcia, Frank Martin and Rolando Romero to name a few. Having also held the WBA super-featherweight, IBF super-featherweight, and WBA super-lightweight belts over the course of his career, Davis will hope to keep a hold of his current title when he goes toe-to-toe with Roach. However, the 29-year-old has been unbeaten since missing out on the WBO super-featherweight strap to Jamel Herring in November 2019 and will prove no easy task for Davis. Since then, Roach has won all six of his subsequent fights, clinching the WBA super-featherweight title with a split-decision win over Hector Luis Garcia in November 2023 and defending it with an eight-round TKO over Feargal McRory last June. Davis and Roach were initially set to face one another on December 14 at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas. However, the bout was postponed in late October and rescheduled for March 2 at New York's Barclays Centre. The showdown between Davis and Roach isn't the only highly-touted event taking place at the weekend, either. Over in Belfast, 20-0 Lewis Crocker hopes to derail 14-0 Paddy Donovan on Saturday as both men look to put themselves in welterweight world title contention. With an action-packed weekend of fighting ahead, The Daily Record breaks down how fight fans can tune in. Davis vs Roach takes place at the Barclays Center in New York on Sunday, March 2. The undercard of the event is scheduled to kick off at 1am UK time, while the main event ring walks are expected to land at around 3am. Crocker's showdown with Donovan takes place at the SSE Arena in Belfast. The undercard for that event is set to start at around 7pm UK time, while the main event ring walks are slated for just before 10pm. As always, both main events could come sooner than anticipated, depending on how quickly the undercards progress. Fans hoping to tune in to watch Davis' clash with Roach will be able to watch along via Amazon PPV for a one-off price of \u00a314.99.

I'm trying to knock everybody out in every round.\" Lewis Crocker: \"Paddy's accurate when he seems to like knock people out and stuff, but that's people making stupid mistakes. I know what's going to happen on fight night, I have everything visualised, I feel so good about this.\" Paddy Donovan: \"There'll be parts where punching will come into it, there'll be parts where boxing will come into it, there'll be parts where heart will come into it. There'll be parts for all different aspects of the game.

The Easter Road gaffer had a good reason to be grumpy during the first half of the campaign after watching his side prop up the Premiership with one win from 14 games. But they have flipped that and could even climb to third with a victory in tomorrow\u2019s derby on home turf. But club legend Gray \u2013 the hero of their 2016 Scottish Cup Final triumph \u2013 admits he is never satisfied and, even though his team are winning, he still barely cracks a smile. Asked if he has sleepless nights as a gaffer, the 36-year-old said: \u201cIt\u2019s not even just the night before the game, it\u2019s all day, every day. It\u2019s certainly something I\u2019ve noticed, especially in recent weeks. \u201cI remember I was speaking to one of the guys, we were talking about the real difficult start, how that was, and the toll that has on me, my family and everything that comes with that. Everybody\u2019s living and breathing it and I\u2019m not the most sociable person in the world anyway, especially around the house. \u201cSo once I went through that period and had a few better results, everybody \u2013 especially my wife \u2013 was thinking, \u2018Oh he might cheer up a wee bit here\u2019. But it just moves on to the next thing. Consistent is probably the right word again, I keep saying that... but consistently miserable is probably right. \u201cYou\u2019re constantly thinking, constantly trying to improve because even if you\u2019ve done really well in the game, there will be areas where you need to improve. You\u2019ve also got players who maybe haven\u2019t played that you need to try to make better every day. \u201cThat\u2019s the big thing, especially for myself and the staff \u2013 our responsibility to keep moving players forward all the time, keep progressing and keep making them better. At whatever your age, you can always try to improve them and that is definitely the mindset all of the time.\u201d Like Hibs, Hearts have gone on an impressive run of form and are only four points further back in sixth spot. It was eighth versus 10th before Hibs ran out 2-1 winners in the Boxing Day tussle at Tynecastle courtesy of Dwight Gayle\u2019s finish 12 minutes from time. Now both have their sights fixed on third spot but Gray is relishing trying to build on his team\u2019s momentum in the famous fixture. He added: \u201cClearly the two sides are in very good form at the moment. \u201cIt\u2019s a very different situation to the last time we met. But as I\u2019ve said already this week \u2013 and reminded the players as well \u2013 that\u2019s irrelevant going into derbies. t\u2019s about understanding the magnitude of the game, which is always there. \u201cEven if we were in different divisions, the rivalry is there, the competitiveness behind it, what it means to the city, the supporters, and everything that goes with that. It\u2019s a fantastic game to look forward to.\u201d Gray loved being involved in the all-Edinburgh clashes as a player and has told his own to make the most of these high-pressure games. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s probably something I talked about with my dad when I stopped playing \u2013 you\u2019re a long time retired, you\u2019ll miss it. These are probably the days when you hear the atmosphere, you feel the noise and the build-up before the game \u2013 they\u2019re special moments as players. \u201cAnd what you need to do is get the message to the players that these sort of games don\u2019t come around all the time. The moments you get if you\u2019re successful at the end of them are memories I\u2019ve had and they live with you forever.\u201d", "summary": "The Hibees go into Sunday's derby clash off the back of a 14-game unbeaten run in all competitions", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/david-gray-admits-stunning-hibs-34774096", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/article34729762.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_Hibernian-FC-v-Celtic-FC-William-Hill-Premiership.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:00:00", "author": "Darren Johnstone", "authors": ["Darren Johnstone"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.284}, {"id": 295541598, "title": "Hamilton v Falkirk: Accies must target a win, we need points, says winger", "text": "Stuart McKinstry says Hamilton must target a first win over Falkirk in seven games as they bid to claw their way further away from the Championship relegation play-off.

John Rankin\u2019s side host leaders Falkirk this afternoon, sitting three points above Dunfermline in the play-off slot, having beat them 1-0 on Tuesday, with McKinstry scoring. McKinstry says it doesn\u2019t matter who Accies play next, they need points.

But the former Motherwell and Leeds United ace said: \u201cWe are at the stage now where we have to look at every game and think we can get something from it. \u201cWe need to keep getting points, with the position we are in. \u201cIt could be Falkirk coming, or it could be Airdrie \u2013 we are not going to look at the game any differently. \u201cWe need to believe we can get something from the game, like we did against Dunfermline. \u201cWith the quality of the squad we\u2019ve got, I don\u2019t think we should be anywhere near where we currently are in the table. \u201cThe quality in our changing room is massive. Some players are maybe not playing with as much confidence as we would like, as a team. \u201cThat\u2019s where we need to pull it together. We definitely did that against Dunfermline, we went as a unit, and that\u2019s what we need to keep doing.\u201d McKinstry has been in and out of the team in recent weeks, but says he\u2019s learned to deal with that scenario, having experienced it at Leeds and on a loan return to Motherwell two seasons ago. He said: \u201cIt has been a tough few weeks, changing formation, which kept me out of the team. \u201cIt has happened to me before in my career, but I maybe looked at it differently this time. \u201cI didn\u2019t let my head go down, and I\u2019ve managed to keep working hard and waiting on my chance. \u201cI kind of knew the chance was going to come, and that I had to be ready for it. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure it was going to be against Dunfermline, but I got my head right, and definitely delivered for the team.\u201d", "summary": "Stuart McKinstry says his side can't be in awe of the Championship leaders", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/hamilton-v-falkirk-accies-must-34753703", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/article34753712.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_Hamilton-vs-Dunfermline-William-Hill-Championship.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:00:00", "author": "Andy McGilvray", "authors": ["Andy McGilvray"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.449}, {"id": 295541600, "title": "Rangers v Motherwell: We're not going to Ibrox to say 'hello', says Well boss", "text": "Michael Wimmer expects a massive challenge from Rangers this afternoon, but says Motherwell present their own threat, and aren't going to Ibrox simply to say \u2018hello\u2019.

He said: \u201cI think it\u2019s a big challenge on Saturday but I like it. To compete with the best teams makes us better. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s easier to arrive at Ibrox after a win. \u201cIt\u2019s a great team, they\u2019re in the last-16 of the Europa League, which says everything. \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to this game, because I hear so many things about this stadium, so I\u2019m really looking forward to being there. \u201cBut our atmosphere [on Wednesday] was also great.

It\u2019s a great team, but we should love the challenge. \u201cI think if we are good out of possession, perhaps we can win the ball. We have ball winners, and then we have good counter-attacks, and we can be dangerous in these scenes. \u201cBut I also want to see that my team is also brave in possession. That they also have the courage to have possession. \u201cBecause if you never have the ball, it\u2019s not fun, and it\u2019s too much suffering. \u201cI want to see that we bring the self-confidence

The month when winter\u2019s icy grip starts to loosen, and the promise of spring is just around the corner. It\u2019s the perfect time to revamp your wardrobe and shake off those dull, heavy layers. But why make it a chore? Grab your favorite strain, spark up, and turn this project into a creative, cannabis-infused adventure.\n\nStart with the Purge\n\nEvery good wardrobe revamp starts with a good purge. Open those drawers, empty the closet, and put everything on display. Now, here\u2019s where the cannabis comes in handy: take a puff of a sativa strain like Sour Diesel or Green Crack (both known for their energizing and focused effects) and start sorting.\n\nAsk yourself:\n\nDoes this bring me joy?\nHave I worn it in the past year?\nCould I pair this with new, upcoming spring pieces?\n\nCannabis can help loosen up emotional attachments to clothes that don\u2019t serve you anymore. It\u2019s like Marie Kondo-ing, but with vibes. Studies even suggest cannabis can enhance creative thinking by stimulating divergent thought processes (Cannabis and Creativity Study, 2015). Who knew purging your wardrobe could feel so\u2026 inspired?\n\nHit the Thrift Stores High\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decluttered, it\u2019s time to shop smart. Thrift stores and vintage shops are goldmines for unique finds, especially when you\u2019re feeling relaxed and open to new ideas. Pair this activity with an indica-leaning hybrid like Blue Dream, which can keep you calm while still sparking a touch of creativity.\n\nWhen thrifting, keep an open mind. That oversized 70s jacket? A statement piece. The funky boots? Perfect for those rainy March days. A well-loved hoodie? Cozy and chic. Bonus: thrifting is sustainable, so you\u2019re doing your part for the planet.\n\nDIY Magic with a Twist\n\nNow, for the fun part\u2014customizing! Nothing says \u201crevamp\u201d like giving your clothes a personal touch. Get crafty with tie-dye, patches, or fabric paint. If you\u2019re lighting up, go for something mellow like Purple Kush to help you settle into the flow.\n\nFor example:\n\nGot a plain white tee? Add some spring-inspired tie-dye (pastels are in!).\nTransform an old denim jacket with patches or embroidery for a fresh vibe.\nCrop those too-long jeans for a cute, cuffed look.\n\nStyle It Up\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got your refreshed pieces, put together outfits that scream March is here! Think light layers for those cool mornings and warmer afternoons. Pair a thrifted floral dress with chunky boots or layer a graphic tee under a blazer for that effortless \u201cI didn\u2019t try, but I look amazing\u201d aesthetic.\n\nCannabis can help you see combinations you might not have thought of sober. Try microdosing an uplifting strain like Jack Herer while styling to keep your mind sharp but playful.\n\nPro Tips to Keep It Fun\n\nPlaylist Power: Create a cannabis-friendly playlist. Think Tame Impala, Bob Marley, or even lo-fi beats to keep the vibe going.\nSnacks on Deck: Wardrobe revamps can be tiring. Have some munchies nearby\u2014fruit, chips, or those fancy Trader Joe\u2019s cookies.\nStay Hydrated: Cannabis and clothes sorting can be dehydrating. Keep water or tea on hand.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nRevamping your wardrobe doesn\u2019t have to be boring.

Mitty\u2019s Ze\u2019Ni Patterson scored 14 of her game-high 17 points in the frame.\n\nIt was also a run in which Scheppler did not call a timeout until his Panthers were down 18-3.\n\n\u201cWe needed to save our timeouts for the end, and I let them get away,\u201d Scheppler said. \u201cIt was too much, and I should\u2019ve have called timeout earlier.\u201d\n\nBeing down big to Mitty was not a new frontier for Pinewood.\n\nMitty had faced Pinewood eight times before in the Open final, all in a row between 2015-23, until St. Ignatius snapped the streak last season.\n\nThe Monarchs have dominated the series, with Pinewood\u2019s only victory being a 50-48 victory in 2021. To the Panthers\u2019 credit, they also earned an epic triple-overtime win over Mitty in the 2018 NorCal Open Division final as well.\n\nAnother game like that looked impossible, even given Mitty\u2019s high-profile absence in forward McKenna Woliczko.\n\nPhillips\u2019 San Jose powerhouse began the season looking like \u2013 and being ranked as \u2013 the best team in the nation.\n\nThat all changed when junior superstar forward and two-time Bay Area News Group player of the year McKenna Woliczko tore her right ACL in an early-January game against SoCal power Ontario Christian.\n\nAny thought that Pinewood would be able to take advantage of her absence \u2013 Woliczko cheered on her teammates while wearing a knee brace from the bench \u2013 was seemingly dashed early as Mitty showed off their new-look athleticism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re athletic, incredibly athletic, and we can defend fairly well when we need to,\u201d Phillip said.\n\nPhillips thought that her team took its foot off the gas in the second quarter, and it showed when Pinewood outscored the Monarchs 12-10 over those eight minutes and then 14-10 in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cI think that when we jumped out to a 27-7 lead, I think the kids thought it was going to be that easy, and it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cSo there was a little bit of a slippery slope with how we attacked the basket, got on the glass. We knew they were going to fight back, and then we just really pressed offensively.\u201d\n\nThe lead grew to 32-9 before Pinewood composed itself.\n\nJolyn Ding and Kuelker combined for 31 points and fueled the Panthers\u2019 9-2 run to begin the fourth period.\n\n\u201cIt took a while to settle in, and the first quarter was the difference in the game, but once we started to see some shots go in, that translated,\u201d Ding said.\n\nBy the time Kuelker made her time-out inducing triple, she couldn\u2019t help but let out a fierce scream as Pinewood (23-4) almost came all the way back. The Panthers outscored Mitty 44-32 over the final three quarters.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an example of the grit of Pinewood,\u201d Scheppler said.\n\nBut it turned out to be too big of a mountain to climb. Every time Pinewood would score, McCarthy answered with a bucket or free throws to clinch the program\u2019s fourth consecutive Open title.\n\nUp next for both teams is regional play, where Mitty \u2013 and likely Pinewood \u2013 will be placed in the NorCal Open bracket.\n\nPhillips made it no secret that she believed her Monarchs (25-3) should be seeded No. 1.\n\n\u201cI mean, three signature wins in the Top 25 in the country, and the only three losses are to Ontario Christian, Sidwell Friends and Morris Catholic, all top 10 teams in the country,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure anyone else in the field has those three wins.\u201d", "summary": "2025 CCS Open Division girls basketball championship game: Archbishop Mitty girls win their 33rd Central Coast Section basketball title under Sue Phillips", "url": "https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/02/28/mitty-girls-survive-pinewood-comeback-in-dramatic-ccs-open-championship-victory/", "image": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BNG-L-CCSGIRLS-0228-06.jpg?w=1024&h=683", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 05:10:58", "author": "Joseph Dycus", "authors": ["Joseph Dycus"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.037}, {"id": 295541566, "title": "Man charged with mailing threatening letters to East Bay school", "text": "OAKLAND \u2014 A 69-year-old Oakland man who worked as a substitute teacher allegedly sent racially charged letters to a San Leandro elementary school threatening to shoot Black students and their teacher, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office said.\n\nLester Dale Lee is charged with one count of mailing threatening communications and one count of false information and hoaxes.

The path to peace and the path to prosperity is, maybe, engaging in diplomacy,\" Vance said, attacking former US President Joe Biden.\"We tried the pathway of Joe Biden, of thumping our chest and pretending that the president of the United States' words mattered more than the president of the United States' actions. What makes America a good country is America engaging in diplomacy. That's what President Trump is doing,\" he added while responding to a question from a reporter. To this, Zelenskyy said if he could ask Vance a question.\"Sure. Yeah,\" Vance responded.\"Okay. So he (Vladimir Putin) occupied it, our parts, big parts of Ukraine, parts of east and Crimea. So, he occupied it in 2014. During a lot of years\u2014I'm not speaking about just Biden, but those times was (Barack) Obama, then President Trump, then President Biden, now President Trump and God bless, now, President Trump will stop him. But during 2014, nobody stopped him. He just occupied and took. He killed people,\" the Ukraine president said.\"Yes, but from 2014 till 2022, the situation was the same. People have been dying on the contact line. Nobody stopped him. You know that we had conversations with him, a lot of conversations.... And we signed a deal with him. (French President Emmanuel) Macron and (former German Chancellor Angela) Merkel signed a ceasefire. All of them told me that he will never go... But after that, he broke the ceasefire, he killed our people, and he didn't exchange prisoners. We signed the exchange of prisoners. But he didn't do it. What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? What do you mean?\" Zelenskyy said.\"I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country,\" the U.S. Vice President responded. Zelenskyy then said, \"Yes, but if you...\" but was interrupted by Vance.\"Mr President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media. Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the frontlines because you have manpower problems. You should be thanking the president,\" Vance said.As the ugly spat continued, Zelenskyy asked Vance if he had \"ever been\" to Ukraine to \"see the problems\" that they have. \"I've actually watched and seen the stories, and I know what happens is you bring people on a propaganda tour, Mr President,\" Vance said.\"Do you disagree that you've had problems with bringing people in your military, and do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?\" he added. In response to this, Zelenskyy said that \"everybody has problems\" during the war, even the US.\"You have nice solutions and don't feel (it) now, but you will feel it in the future,\" he said, triggering Trump. \"You don't know that. Don't tell us what we're going to feel. We're trying to solve a problem. Don't tell us what we're going to feel,\" Trump responded. \"I am not telling you, I am answering...,\" Zelenskyy said.Trump then raised his voice and said, \"You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel.

You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position,\" Trump added as Zelensky tried to interrupt him. \"You're gambling with the lives of millions of people, you're gambling with World War III, and what you're doing is very disrespectful to this country,\" the 78-year-old U.S. President said. Vance then asked Zelenskyy if he had said \"thank you even once.\"\"A lot of times,\" Zelenskyy answered. \"No, in this meeting, this entire meeting? Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who's trying to save your country,\" Vance said. Zelenskyy then said, \"Yes, you think that if you will speak very loudly about the war...\" but was again cut off by Trump.\"He's not speaking loud. Your country is in big trouble. No, no, you've done a lot of talking. Your country is in big trouble,\" Trump said. \"You're not winning this. You have a damn good chance of coming out OK, because of us,\" he added. Trump also told Zelenskyy that if Ukraine didn't have the U.S.'s military equipment, the war would have been over in two weeks.\"I heard it from Putin in three days,\" Zelenskyy responded. \"It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,\" Trump said. \"You're buried there. Your people are dying. You're running low on soldiers. No, listen... And then you tell us, 'I don't want a cease fire. I don't want a cease fire. I want to go and I want this',\" he added. \"You're not acting at all thankful. And that's not a nice thing. I'll be honest, that's not a nice thing. All right, I think we've seen enough. What do you think? Great television. I will say that,\" he said.Trump on spat with ZelenskyyAfter the argument, Donald Trump posted on social media that Volodymyr Zelenskyy \"can come back when he is ready for peace.\" \u201cWe had a very meaningful meeting in the White House today.

At the Global Business Summit 2025 in mid-February, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the formation of a Deregulation Commission to eliminate hundreds of compliances and further streamline regulatory processes.\n\nHe noted that the Goods and Services Tax regime introduced in 2017 has created a single large market by removing state levies, significantly benefiting industries by simplifying taxation and fostering economic integration.\n\nModi\u2019s statement was a takeoff from Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman\u2019s budget speech, in which she highlighted the need to promote ease of doing business, update old laws and develop a flexible, people-friendly and trust-based regulatory framework.\n\nThe cry for deregulation has echoes in the new US Department of Government Efficiency under Elon Musk in the Donald Trump dispensation, whose objectives include streamlining government agencies and cutting \u201cred tape\u201d.\n\nIt echoes the initiative taken by the United Kingdom in October 2024 to open a new Regulatory Innovation office to speed up the introduction of new technologies like artificial intelligence.\n\nThe thrust of deregulation is predicated on the claim that allowing business full freedom will allow it to achieve full efficiency. However, this is not always the case. As key economists have noted, state intervention and regulation are necessary when the cost to society outweighs the gains.\n\nIn his remarkable book The Road to Freedom, the Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz argues that more regulation is required rather than less, particularly in areas like the environment and the financial sector.\n\nHe notes that the United Nations-appointed committee that he headed established that the US financial crisis of 2008 was a big wake-up call about the fallibility of capitalism and the myth that \u201cbig banks do not fail\u201d.\n\nInstead, the inadequate oversight and regulation of the financial industry, particularly in mortgage lending and securitisation, allowed risky practices to go unchecked.\n\nAccording to Stiglitz, the economic system most conducive to a good society is progressive capitalism where there is dispersed power, reduced inequality, and a rich \u201cecology of institutions\u201d. The changing nature of our society and economy requires \u201cmore government intervention and public investment, higher taxes and more taxation\u201d.\n\nSuch an approach is in direct contrast to the case for minimal government and regulation made by his principal ideological adversary, Friedrich Hayek. In his book The Road to Serfdom written in 1944, Hayker had famously declared, \u201cIf you put the federal government in charge of the Sahara Desert, in five years there\u2019d be a shortage of sand.\u201d\n\nBritish Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, an admirer of Hayek, handed out copies of Road to Serfdom at cabinet meetings.\n\nBut Stiglitz believes that Thacher\u2019s favorite thinker was responsible for the \u201cdesertification of human hope\u201d. The neoliberalism of US President Ronald Regan, Thatcher, and now of Trump, and the urge to dismantle all kinds of regulations bring to mind an observation of philosopher Isiah Berlin: \u201cFreedom for the wolves has often meant death to the sheep.\u201d\n\nThis was borne out in the US in the 1990s, with the repeal in 1999 of the Glass-Steagall Act passed in 1933 in the wake of the Great Depression. This act had prevented commercial banks from making speculative investments that could jeopardise depositors\u2019 savings. The removal of this safeguard, Stiglitz, allowed commercial banks to make risky investments and eventually caused the US financial crisis of 2008.\n\nThe recent thrust for deregulation is a continuation of the programme launched in the 1980s by US President Ronald Reagen, who began to dismantle the welfare role that the state had played since the economic depression of the 1930s. Instead, Reagen embraced the market fundamentalism advocated by Fredrich Hayek and Milton Friedman.\n\nIt also ushered in the dismantling of regulatory bodies for airlines, railways and electric power generation. The sharp reduction in tax rates for the super-rich fitted into the economic rhetoric of Reagan\u2019s economist advisor Arthur Laffer that this would result in better tax compliance and generate higher revenues for the government.\n\nIndia adopted this ideology in 1991 when it dispensed with the licence permit quota raj to embrace liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation by substantially dumping the dirigiste regime it had followed under Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. It has changed the economic contours of India forever.\n\nThe dominant economic role of Public Sector Units shifted to the private sector. The bureaucracy moved from being controllers to regulators, from masters to enablers.\n\nThe changes, as intended, revved up the rate of growth, which had long stagnated at 3.5%. But, as Nobel laureate Amartya Sen noted, it had the unintended consequence of accentuating income inequality, by turning a blind eye to distributive justice.\n\nThe claims that gains at the top would \u201ctrickle down\u201d to those at the bottom proved to be hollow, both in the US and in India.\n\nIn terms of regulation, however, India witnessed the creation of a slew of regulatory bodies and laws such as the Securities and Exchange Board in 1992 to regulate the stock market operation, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India and the Foreign Exchange Management Act in 1999, the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority in 2003 and the Consumer Protection Act in 2019.\n\nAfter the 2008 US financial crisis, the government constituted the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission, which recommended that the Reserve Bank of India should regulate the banks and payments but be divested of its debt management function. This function, it suggested, should be vested in an independent debt manager, as is in the US and the UK.\n\nThe committee also recommended the creation of a unified regulator for the rest of the finance sector and a financial redressal agency. Most of its recommendations have yet to become reality.\n\nHowever, chastened by the US financial crisis, a Financial Stability Development Council was set up in 2010 under the chairmanship of the finance minister, with heads of all financial sector regulators as members, to strengthen and institutionalise the mechanisms for maintaining financial stability, financial sector development, inter-regulatory coordination along with monitoring macro-prudential regulation of the economy.\n\nIt is to the credit of the Reserve Bank that India waded through the US financial crisis with the central bank managing India\u2019s economy well.\n\nBut given the historical red flags, India must proceed with utmost caution before emulating Trump\u2019s experiments. In particular, Stiglitz\u2019s cautionary note about the importance of beefing up the regulatory architecture of the financial sector and environment must not be glossed over.\n\nAs the new Reserve Bank of India Governor Sanjay Malhotra has pointed out in the context of deregulation, India needs to be wary of the tradeoff between \u201cstability and efficiency\u201d.\n\nSatya Narayan Misra is Professor Emeritus at Kiit University, Bhubaneswar.", "summary": "Given the historical red flags, India must be wary of easing compliance requirements at the cost of societal well-being and economic stability.", "url": "https://scroll.in/article/1079755/freedom-for-the-wolves-death-for-the-sheep-the-pitfalls-of-unbridled-business-deregulation", "image": "https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/186040-supwkoxbbf-1674569449.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 03:30:00", "author": "Satya Narayan Misra", "authors": ["Satya Narayan Misra"], "language": "en", "source_country": "IN", "sentiment": 0.063}, {"id": 295527778, "title": "Understanding the Trump-Zelensky faceoff: A fraught minerals deal with vague US commitments", "text": "The visit of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to the White House has not gone to plan \u2013 at least not to his plan. There were extraordinary scenes as a press conference on Friday night between Zelensky and Trump descended into acrimony, with the US president loudly berating his opposite number, who he accused of \u201cgambling with World War III\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou either make a deal or we\u2019re out,\u201d Trump told Zelensky. His vice-president, JD Vance, also got in on the act, accusing the Ukrainian president of \u201clitigating in front of the American media\u201d, and saying his approach was \u201cdisrespectful\u201d. At one point he asked Zelensky: \u201cHave you said thank you even once?\u201d\n\nReporters present described the atmosphere as heated with voices raised by both Trump and Vance. The New York Times said the scene was \u201cone of the most dramatic moments ever to play out in public in the Oval Office and underscored the radical break between the United States and Ukraine since Mr Trump took office\u201d.\n\nUnderlying the angry exchanges were differences between the Trump administration and the Ukrainian government over the so-called minerals deal that Zelensky was scheduled to sign. But any lack of Ukrainian enthusiasm for the deal is understandable.\n\nIn its present form, it looks more like a memorandum of understanding that leaves several vital issues to be resolved later. The deal on offer is the creation of what will be called a \u201creconstruction investment fund\u201d, to be jointly owned and managed by the US and Ukraine.\n\nInto the proposed fund will go 50% of the revenue from the exploitation of \u201call relevant Ukrainian government-owned natural resource assets (whether owned directly or indirectly by the Ukrainian government)\u201d and \u201cother infrastructure relevant to natural resource assets (such as liquified natural gas terminals and port infrastructure)\u201d.\n\nThis means that private infrastructure \u2013 much of it owned by Ukraine\u2019s wealthy oligarchs \u2013 is likely to become part of the deal. This has the potential of further increasing friction between Zelensky and some very powerful Ukrainians.\n\nMeanwhile, US contributions are less clearly defined. The preamble to the agreement makes it clear that Ukraine already owes the US. The very first paragraph notes that \u201cthe United States of America has provided significant financial and material support to Ukraine since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022\u201d.\n\nThis figure, according to Trump, amounts to $350 billion. The actual amount, according to the Ukraine Support Tracker of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, is about half that.\n\nWestern and Ukrainian analysts have also pointed out that there may be fewer and less accessible mineral and rare earth deposits in Ukraine than are currently assumed. The working estimates have been based mostly on Soviet-era data.\n\nSince the current draft leaves details on ownership, governance and operations to be determined in a future fund agreement, Trump\u2019s very big deal is at best the first step. Future rounds of negotiations are to be expected.\n\nStatement of intent\n\nFrom a Ukrainian perspective, this is more of a strength than a weakness. It leaves Kyiv with an opportunity to achieve more satisfactory terms in future rounds of negotiation. Even if any improvements will only be marginal, it keeps the US locked into a process that is, overall, beneficial for Ukraine.\n\nTake the example of security guarantees. The draft agreement offers Ukraine nothing anywhere near Nato membership. But it notes that the US \u201csupports Ukraine\u2019s efforts to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace\u201d, adding that: \u201cParticipants will seek to identify any necessary steps to protect mutual investments.\u201d\n\nThe significance of this should not be overstated. At its bare minimum, it is an expression of intent by the US that falls short of security guarantees but still gives the US a stake in the survival of Ukraine as an independent state.\n\nBut it is an important signal both in terms of what it does and does not do \u2013 a signal to Russia, Europe and Ukraine.\n\nTrump does not envisage that the US will give Ukraine security guarantees \u201cbeyond very much\u201d. He seems to think that these guarantees can be provided by European troops (the Kremlin has already cast doubts on this idea).\n\nBut this does not mean the idea is completely off the table. On the contrary, because the US commitment is so vague, it gives Trump leverage in every direction.\n\nHe can use it as a carrot and a stick against Ukraine to get more favourable terms for US returns from the reconstruction investment fund. He can use it to push Europe towards more decisive action to ramp up defence spending by making any US protection for European peacekeepers contingent on more equitable burden-sharing in Nato.\n\nAnd he can signal to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, that the US is serious about making a deal stick \u2013 and that higher American economic stakes in Ukraine and corporate presence on the ground would mean US-backed consequences if the Kremlin reneges on a future peace agreement and restarts hostilities.\n\nThat these calculations will ultimately lead to the \u201cfree, sovereign and secure Ukraine\u201d that the agreement envisages is not a given.\n\nFor now, however, despite all the shortcomings and vagueness of the deal on key issues \u2013 and the very public argument between the parties \u2013 it still looks like it serves all sides\u2019 interests in moving forward in this direction.\n\nThis article first appeared on The Conversation.", "summary": "It envisages the creation of a \u2018reconstruction investment fund\u2019 to be jointly owned and managed by the US and Ukraine.", "url": "https://scroll.in/article/1079763/understanding-the-trump-zelensky-faceoff-a-fraught-minerals-deal-with-vague-us-commitments", "image": "https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/206066-dcntoplwrb-1740806269.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 05:18:25", "author": "Stefan Wolff,The Conversation", "authors": ["Stefan Wolff", "The Conversation"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "IN", "sentiment": -0.108}, {"id": 295527774, "title": "Uttarakhand: 47 workers rescued, eight still feared trapped after Chamoli avalanche", "text": "Forty-seven workers have been rescued and eight remain missing after an avalanche in Uttarakhand\u2019s Chamoli district on Friday, ANI quoted officials as saying on Saturday.\n\nThe avalanche struck between Mana village and Mana Pass on Friday morning, the India Today reported.\n\nThe workers at a Border Roads Organisation project site were clearing snow.

From Group \u2018A\u2019, India and New Zealand have already reached the last-four stage.\n\nAustralia, the world champions, were racing towards the 274-run target \u2014 with 109-1 in 12.5 overs \u2014 when the umpires were forced to stop play due to heavy rain which continued for about half an hour. Efforts were made to dry the outfield with a machine before the cut-off time of 10:11pm but the umpires at around 8:50pm called off the match as the major part of the ground was still to be dried.\n\nAfter Afghanistan fielders dropped both openers, Matthew Short and a dangerous-looking Travis Head launched a full-fledged attack with the bat plundering 44 in just 4.4 overs. They must have kept in view the weather forecast and possible Duckworth-Lewis (D/L) method and related calculations.\n\nAfter cracking a 15-ball 20, Short was caught by Gulbadin Naib at mid-on off fast bowler Azmatullah Omarzai bringing the crowd, many among them Afghanistan spectators, to their feet. However, that was the only time the boisterous fans of Hashmatullah Shahidi and his men rejoiced under lights.\n\nThe departure of Short did not prevent Head from playing his typically aggressive game as captain Steve Smith joined left-hander. Australia cruised to 100 mark in just 12 overs as Head completed his 17th ODI half-century off only 34 balls. He remained not out on 59 off 40 balls with the help of nine fours and a six. Smith was unbeaten on 19 from 22 balls.\n\nAs left-arm wrist spinner Noor Ahmad was belted by Head for a four in the 13th over, heavy rain started to spoil the game which was never resumed.\n\nThe Afghanistan pacers proved expensive as Omarzai gave away 43 runs in five overs, while fellow pacer Fazalhaq Farooqi leaked 32 in three. Only Mohammad Nabi was economical (0-13 in three overs).\n\nEarlier, Afghanistan after electing to bat first posted a decent total in a virtually knockout clash.\n\nAfter losing Rahmanullah Gu-r-baz who was bowled for a duck by pacer Spencer Johnson in the first over of the innings, Sediqullah Atal alongside in-form opener Ibrahim Zadran added 67.\n\nAt 70-1 in the 14th over, Zadran (22) was sent back by leg-spinner Adam Zampa as the batter was caught by Marnus Labuschagne at backward point. Rahmat Shah was caught behind by wicket-keeper Josh Inglis for a 21-ball 12 off occasional spinner Glenn Maxwell.\n\nWhile Afghanistan kept losing wickets at one end \u2014 and could not develop a big partnership \u2014 Sediqullah with some solid strok-eplay kept the other end intact.\n\nThe 23-year-old left-hander smashed six fours and three sixes during his 95-ball 85 which was his second ODI fifty.\n\nAfter losing Rahmat at 91 in the 19th over, Sediqullah and Shahidi added 68 off 78 balls for the fourth wicket before the former was dismissed by Johnson as the batter looking to drive was caught in the cover by Smith. Shahidi after making a slower than normal 49-ball 20 was taken at backward square leg while attempting to sweep Zampa.\n\nSoon Nabi (one) was run out as Afghanistan crumbled to 182-6 in the 37th over and when Naib departed at the end of the 40th over the score read 199-7.\n\nOmarzai at this stage came to the rescue, playing a crucial role in making sure Afghanistan reach a fighting score.\n\nStriking five sixes during his 63-ball 67 \u2014 his eighth half-century \u2014 including three to pacer Nathan Ellis and one each to Matt Short and Zampa, Omarzai combined with tailenders Rashid Khan (17) and others to steer his team to safety as they collected 74 runs in the final 10 overs.\n\nOmarzai was finally dismissed in the last over by fast bowler Ben Dwarshuis as the right-hander trying an inside-out shot was caught at deep cover by Alex Carey.\n\nExtras, including 17 wides, contributed 37 runs.\n\nDwarshuis claimed three wickets for 47 in nine overs, Johnson grabbed 2-49 while Zampa snared two for 48 in eight overs.

While she had no fear of getting older \u2013 and actually thinks this is going to be her best decade yet \u2013 the milestone triggered some self reflection.\n\n\u201cIt feels like yesterday that I turned 21, but it also feels like it was 222 years ago,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cI know I\u2019m older, and time is going fast, but I want to embrace it and be excited about my forties. I\u2019m more confident and comfortable in myself than I used to be, and I want to make the most of whatever exciting things might come my way.\u201d\n\nOne of her current favourite \u201cthings\u201d is her boyfriend of three-and-a-half years, Hollyoaks alumni Anthony who played Gilly Roach from 2005 to 2011.\n\nThe couple, who live together in the North West, confirmed their romance in 2022 but keep their relationship largely private.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to talk too much about my personal life, but I will say I\u2019m the happiest I\u2019ve ever been, Anthony is incredible\u201d she grins, when we ask about whether they\u2019ve talked about marriage or babies. \u201cI\u2019m in a wonderful, happy relationship, so let\u2019s see what the future holds! Anthony really is my rock, he\u2019s been incredibly supportive of me in my tough decision to leave Hollyoaks.\u201d\n\nHaving a fellow actor as a partner has also helped boost her confidence and lessen her worries about navigating what\u2019s to come in terms of work.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s also been through similar experiences and can fully understand the emotions you go through when it comes to making huge life decisions like this,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s also been in the same position as me in the past, deciding whether it\u2019s the right time or not to leave a role.

I know it\u2019s corny to say but I\u2019m very lucky that I\u2019ve got a lot of people in my life that genuinely care about me and my life decisions, and Anthony is one of those people.\u201d\n\nNikki made her first appearance on the Channel 4 soap as Maxine in November 2012, aged 28, after becoming a household name playing hairstylist Candice Stowe on Coronation Street from 1999 to 2005.\n\nAfter clocking up almost 400 episodes on Corrie, and another 500-plus on Hollyoaks, she plans to take full advantage of the opportunity to \u201cdecompress\u201d and enjoy some much-loved Saturday lie-ins. \u201cOf course I love what I do, it\u2019s what I\u2019ve done since I was young, so I\u2019d love to dive straight into my next acting job if that\u2019s a possibility, but actually for the first time in a long time I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Ooh if I want to go away this weekend, I can just go!\u2019\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m going to indulge in that a bit while I can, decompress and rest mentally and physically. I can recharge for a bit and then get cracking.\u201d\n\nNikki opened up a few years ago about struggling with depression in her twenties, and revealed that she relied on her incredible support network, especially her mum Jude, as well as therapy and medication to help her recover. Now that she\u2019s the happiest she\u2019s ever been, she tells us, she\u2019s more comfortable sharing her experience.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve suffered in the past and I didn\u2019t talk about it because, let\u2019s face it, up until recently it was a bit of a taboo subject,\u201d she shares. \u201cI think it\u2019s fantastic that nowadays people can openly talk about mental health. And if they\u2019re struggling, there\u2019s so many places and people and organisations to be able to get help.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m lucky that right now I\u2019m in a really good place. Also, there\u2019s a huge link between my physical and mental health, so when I\u2019m working out and being healthy, I feel better about myself, and I think it radiates.\u201d Nikki, who won the Inside Soap Award for Outstanding Achievement in 2023, has tackled some difficult topics as Maxine \u2013 from domestic abuse, coping with a terminal illness, ending a pregnancy and suffering Munchausen syndrome.\n\nDespite the weeks and months spent filming what were sometimes extremely harrowing scenes, Nikki says she\u2019s fiercely proud of her work, especially her domestic abuse storyline with co-star Jeremy Sheffield, who played Patrick Blake. She also filmed a special episode in 2022, The Long Walk Home, in which Maxine was violently attacked after finding herself navigating her way home alone after a girl\u2019s night out. It was made with input from the Government\u2019s Enough campaign, which tackles violence against females.\n\n\u201cWhat made it so great was not just how they wrote it and shot it, but how everything was so relatable,\u201d Nikki says. \u201cA lot of people could say, \u2018I\u2019ve been inthat situation, I\u2019ve felt those same feelings, I have felt that fear\u2019. The whole thing was just phenomenal.\u201d\n\nGiven how emotionally draining some of her storylines have been, how has she coped with the physical and emotional burden of her role for so long? \n\n\u201cYou need the support system,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you were to stay in that state of mind for a long period of time it\u2019s extremely difficult to break out or snap out of it. When I\u2019ve been doing storylines like that I try to make sure that when I finish work, I mentally finish.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019ll get on the phone to my partner, or to my family or my friends, and talk about happy things, good things, and make plans.\u201d\n\nNikki is very aware that she\u2019s lucky enough to be able to \u201cdecompress\u201d at the end of the day, and knows that many others aren\u2019t so fortunate because \u201cthey\u2019re living it, it\u2019s their life\u201d.\n\n\u201cSome of the storylines that I\u2019m most grateful for have been really quite dark, and I like to really research topics and know what I\u2019m doing, so I get very immersed in them,\u201d she shares. \u201cI know there are very real victims out there of these very real circumstances who will be watching and you want to do them justice for what they\u2019ve been through, and the trauma they\u2019ve been through.\u201d\n\nWhile the details of her final scenes are top secret, Nikki reveals they\u2019ll involve some of the cast she first filmed with, including Anna Passey (who plays Sienna Blake), Tamara Wall (Grace Black) and Danny Mac (Dodger Savage).\n\nHer departure will be bittersweet as she\u2019ll miss many of her co-stars, she says, but the friendships she has made will long outstay Maxine.\n\nAfter spending much of her working life on soaps, which were once considered in the industry as almost jobs for life, Nikki is excited \u2013 and understandably nervous \u2013 about dipping her toe back into the world of auditions. \u201cNow you have show reels and self tapes, but I never had to do that as you were just in a room with a casting director,\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the digital CV, whereas before you had the Spotlight catalogue which was like a Yellow Pages for actors!\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about learning about this new world but I also have fear because I\u2019m under no illusions of how the industry works, and there\u2019s always the potential that you\u2019ll never work again.\n\n\u201cBut I want to be as positive as possible and see myself in these really incredible productions out there, and I\u2019ll do everything in my power to be able to do that.\u201d\n\nAnd what about the question that seems to follow every former Corrie character... would she ever step back onto the cobbles? \u201cNever say never is my approach,\u201d she replies. \u201cI love Candice and I love Coronation Street, so I\u2019d never close myself to anything if they did want me back in the future, that\u2019s the exciting thing about doing what I do. You just never know what might happen next.\n\n\u201cWho knew way back when as a little girl going to drama classes at The Carol Godby Theatre Workshop I\u2019d spend the next 30 years working because of them?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m under no illusion that it\u2019s much tougher than it used to be out there, but I\u2019m positive and have faith that I\u2019ll achieve all I dream of in life, especially having Anthony, my family, and my friends by my side.\u201d", "summary": "EXCLUSIVE: Hollyoaks' Nikki Sanderson opens up for the first time on her exit from the soap, her relationship and whether a return to the Cobbles is on the cards", "url": "https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/exclusive-nikki-sanderson-hollyoaks-star-34770384", "image": "https://i2-prod.ok.co.uk/incoming/article34773703.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SOCIAL-TEMPLATE2023-1.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 07:00:00", "author": "Shelley Spadoni", "authors": ["Shelley Spadoni"], "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.598}, {"id": 295551882, "title": "Inside Sheridan Smith\u2019s heartache after ex\u2019s shock death at 39 - \u2018All she wants is love\u2019", "text": "Sheridan Smith has been dealt a devastating blow with the sudden death of her ex-boyfriend in LA at just 39. Celebrity stylist Graham Nation, who has worked with big names like Demi Moore, Jared Leto and Venus Williams, tragically passed away after collapsing in a gym on Valentine's Day. The case is now under further investigation by the LA County Department of Medical Examiner. Graham, who is believed to have first met Sheridan when he was styling her hair for a shoot, leaves behind his makeup artist partner Tonya Brewer and their six-month-old son, Romeo.\n\nSheridan, 43, was romantically involved with the celebrity stylist in 2017, referring to him as her \"dream man\". She once posted a loved-up picture of them together with the caption, \"Look how fit my man is #punching,\" When they parted ways, a source reportedly told a newspaper that Sheridan was heartbroken after Graham \u201cmoved out\u201d of her London home, claiming, \u201cThere is no animosity and Graham is still there for her, but she feels quite lonely at the moment.\u201d\n\nIt would be understandable if the news has hit Sheridan hard. As well as the pain of his loss, her ex\u2019s death must surely also act as a poignant reminder to mum-of- one Sheridan \u2013 who is currently thought to be single \u2013 that, despite several high-profile relationships, she is yet to find The One.\n\nLast May, the actress \u2013 who has had a tumultuous love life and battled well-documented addiction and mental health issues over the years \u2013 confessed that she had rejoined dating apps. This decision came three years after her split from ex-fiance\u0301 Jamie Horn, who she met on Tinder and welcomed her son, Billy, with in 2020.\n\nAt the time of their separation, she said she was \"still figuring out\" her love life but was more than \"happy\" spending her time with her little boy. Speaking about being in the acting industry, she admitted, \"It's hard to let anyone into that world, and for anyone to want to be part of that world as well, so who knows what the future holds, but I'm happy.\"\n\nSheridan has previously opened up about her love life, admitting that while she feels she's \"good\" at being single, her friends might not agree. She said: \"Of course, I'd love to get older with somebody, but if I don't I've got my boy and I live for him. It's me and him against the world. Everything is for him, so I don't feel the need now to be dating like I always used to. Hopefully one day, someone will love me for me.\"\n\nThe actress has had a series of high-profile relationships, including a year-long romance with Gavin and Stacey co-star James Corden in 2007. They briefly rekindled their relationship in 2009, with James once describing Sheridan as \"the love of his life\". In 2010, Sheridan was linked to Scottish actor Ross McCall, before starting a relationship with Hollyoaks star Greg Wood in 2015. The couple even got matching tattoos, but by July 2015 they had split.\n\nAfter separating from the father of her son Billy, Jamie Horn, Sheridan reconnected with an old flame, actor Alex Lawler, in 2021. However, by January 2022, it was announced that they had split. A brief relationship in 2023 with former boxer Dave \"Rocky\" Ryan also reportedly \"fizzled out\". in spring 2024.\n\nAmidst all the romantic turbulence, Sheridan has been candid about her mental health battles, which peaked following the death of her dear father Colin from cancer in 2016. This heartbreaking loss, she expressed, felt like a ''double grieving\", as it brought back the trauma of losing her older brother Julian to the same disease \u2013 when she was just eight and he was 18. \n\nOn The Jonathan Ross Show, while discussing her decision to withdraw from performing in the musical Funny Girl, Sheridan courageously spoke about her breakdown. She said, \"It was a gradual build-up when my dad got diagnosed and I just couldn't continue, I lost my mind, I completely did, to the point where people were stopping me in the street and cuddling me because people understand that, it's just life. \" \n\nIt's evident that Sheridan is still on the hunt for that everlasting love that, unlike her acting success, seems to have evaded her so far.

Would you prefer for your character to die if you're going, or to go in the back of a taxi? If it's a taxi, you could potentially go back. That's the most comfortable way.\"\n\nHowever, following a remarkable run as Amy, Natalie felt it was time to bid farewell to the soap. \"The show said, 'We just think Amy's too big of a character to go in a taxi.

Taruna hails from a well-known business family based in London, bringing a blend of international flair to the Sinha family.Since her marriage, Taruna has been an integral part of the Sinha family, often seen accompanying them to social events and family gatherings. Despite her high-profile in-laws, Taruna maintains a relatively low-key profile, focusing on her personal life and family commitments.The Sinha family is known for their strong bonds and close relationships. Sonakshi often shares glimpses of her family life on social media, showcasing the love and support they share. Taruna's presence has added another layer of warmth and love to the family.Meanwhile, Sonakshi married actor Zaheer Iqbal in June 2024, marking the culmination of their seven-year relationship.

The 39-year-old, who played 46 ODIs (934 runs@25.94) and 13 T20Is (24.90) from 2006-2015, feels that India's power-packed batting line-up actually missed out on \"scoring heavily\" on the featherbeds of Pakistan during the tournament, being forced to play on the slow pitch of Dubai, where run-scoring has comparatively been tougher.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!\"India could have complained that had they played on flat Pakistani pitches, their record could have been nicer. Each batsman would have got an opportunity to score (heavily). You may say whatever, but at the end of the day, cricket is a contest between bat and ball and the team which plays well on that day wins. And those who complain, you can sense their mental state. It becomes so obvious,\" Uthappa said.Uthappa said that while India did enjoy an edge in the Champions Trophy in terms of having an opportunity to become familiar with the conditions in Dubai, it must also be taken into account that they had \"the right to decide if they don\u2019t want to travel to a particular nation due to the geo-political situation.\" 118643011\"I will not say it\u2019s a home advantage but there is definitely an advantage of familiarity. I heard an interview where former India opener Wasim Jaffer was saying that there could have been one match in Abu Dhabi, one in Dubai and one in Sharjah, and definitely that could have been done so that other teams couldn\u2019t find a reason to complain. However, we must ask why didn\u2019t we go to Pakistan? Because of the geo-political situation. And each country has their right to decide if they don\u2019t want to travel to a particular nation. And for that, if one country ends up playing in one venue then so be it,\" Uthappa said during a book launch, here on Friday evening.Giving his take on the controversy, former India opener and current UAE head coach Lalchand Rajput said that India were definitely at an advantage in the 2025 Champions Trophy as it wasn\u2019t easy for visiting teams to get used to the Dubai pitch quickly. \"See, there is definitely an advantage as one team is playing all matches in one venue. But if you look closely, Pakistani pitches are flat while Dubai is on the slower side and it will take some effort to get used to these conditions quickly.\"Uthappa said it shouldn't matter to India who their semifinal opponents would be from Group B - it could be either Australia or South Africa - and the 2023 ODI World Cup finalists should just focus on their own \"form, strength and mood of the team.\"\"Genuinely as a cricketer it does not matter to us as to who is going to be our opponent. We as a team should focus on our form, strength and mood of the team, which is more important than who we are going to face or the pitches we are going to play on. It doesn\u2019t matter much. Any team which is confident and in form would never think on those lines. They will concentrate on what we are going to do to win the game,\" Uthappa said. 118629957'Had predicted that Kohli would break Tendulkar's record'For someone who had coached Virat Kohli when the latter was playing for the India under-19 team in 2006 where he was the head coach, Rajput reminded everyone that he had predicted \"very early that Kohli would end up breaking (the legendary) Sachin Tendulkar's colossal records in international cricket.\u201dTalking about the Indian cricketing superstar, who is set to feature in his 300th ODI, Rajput said, \"To be very honest, I had predicted very early that he would break Tendulkar's record. He still has got the same hunger and passion and 300 is a lot of games. He is still so fit and every run is so important for him and he values his wicket. He doesn't want to throw his wicket. That is why he is the No. 1 (batter in world cricket.)\u201dShowering praise on India captain Rohit Sharma for \"keeping the dressing room\u201d happy with his jovial nature, Rajput hoped that India would win one more ICC trophy - they triumphed in the 2024 T20 World Cup last year - under his captaincy.\"As a captain, he is the best so far with young players. He keeps the dressing room very happy, because he allows the batsmen to perform well and doesn't put any pressure, and he is a jolly good fellow. He keeps the mood very light and that is what you saw in the West Indies when India won the T20 World Cup. Apart from the captain, he is also a friend, philosopher, and guide for many players. So, I think this CT will be another feather in his cap. And the way India has played so far, I do believe that there is another global trophy that India can win,\u201d Rajput concluded.", "summary": "The 2025 ICC Champions Trophy faced criticism due to India's matches being confined to Dubai, amidst claims of 'unfair advantage'.

In a judgment delivered by Justice Emmanuel Akomaye Agim, the Supreme Court also ordered the 27- members of Rivers House of Assembly to resume function immediately. The unanimous judgment of the 5-man panel of Justices led by Justice Musa Uwani Aba-Aji dismantled all actions carried out by Governor Fubara for being unlawful. The apex court also- declared as invalid, ille- gal, null and void, the local government election con- ducted in Rivers state on October 5, 2024 and won by the All People\u2019s Party APP. The Apex Court held that the election was invalid because all conditions precedent billed to be im- plemented were jettisoned by Rivers State Electoral Commission. Specifically, Justice Jamilu Tukur who delivered the lead verdict held that the council poll was conduct- ed in gross violations of section 150 of the Electoral Act 2022. A Federal High court in Abuja on September 30, 2024 had stopped the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from releasing voters register to the Rivers State Independent Electoral Commission (RSIEC) for the purpose of conducting the October 5, 2024 local government elections in the state.\n\nThe Court had also barred the Inspector General of Police IGP and the Department of the State Ser- vice DSS from providing security. Justice Peter Lifu issued the order against INEC, while delivering judgment in a suit brought before him by the All Progressives Congress (APC). The suit was argued on behalf of the APC by a team of senior lawyers comprising Joseph Daudu, Sebas- tine Hon and Ogwu James Onoja, all SANs. Justice Lifu held that the RSIEC was wrong in fixing the October 5 date for the conduct of the poll into the 23 local governments when all relevant laws guiding the election had not been complied with. Among others, the Judge held that the failure of Rivers Electoral body violated the provision of local government election conduct law by not publishing the mandatory 90 days\u2019 notice before fixing the date. Justice Peter Lifu also held that the update and revision of the voter reg- ister ought to have been concluded before an election date conduct is legally and validity fixed in law.\n\nThe Judge therefore or- dered INEC not to make the certified voter register available to RSIEC until the law has been fully com- plied with. Justice Peter Lifu also barred RSIEC from accept- ing any voter register from INEC or using it for the purpose of the October 5 local government poll. The Supreme Court also ordered the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN and the Accountant General of the Federation to shop further releasing financial allocations to Rivers State Government with immedi- ate effect. The Apex Court direct- ed that the order shall be in force until Governor Fubara stops all his illegal, unlawful and unconstitutional activities. Specifically, the Court said that no money shall be released to the state government until a law- ful Appropriation Law is enacted under the Martin Amaewhule Speakership. In a judgment delivered by Justice Emmanuel Ako- maye Agim, the Supreme Court also ordered the 27- members of Rivers House of Assembly to resume function immediately.\n\nThe unanimous judgment of the 5-man panel of Justices led by Justice Musa Uwani Aba-Aji dismantled all actions carried out by Governor Fubara for being unlawful. The Apex court lambast- ed the governor for engag- ing in criminal activity of demolishing the House of Assembly with impunity just to prevent 27 legislators in the House of Assembly from sitting to carry out lawful activities.\n\nJustice Agim ordered the Clerk and Deputy Clerk who were unlawfully redeployed out of the House of Assembly must be allowed to resume work alongside the Assembly workers. The court held that it was an aberration for Fubara to operate with only 4 out of the 32 House of Assembly members under the guise of baseless fears that he would be impeached. According to the Jus- tices, Fubara by his un- lawful act among others, collapsed the House of assembly and used his im- munity under section 308 of the 1999 Constitution to carry out barbaric acts against the rule of law. The Supreme Court af- firmed the judgments of the Court of Appeal and the Federal high court, both in Abuja which had earlier declared the acts against the 27 state of House of Assembly members as unlawful and illegal.\n\nA sum of N10m fine was imposed on Fubara to be paid to the House of Assembly and the 27 members who instituted the suit against him. The federal high court had held that the receipt and disbursement of monthly allocations since January last year by Fuba- ra was a Constitutional summersault and aberra- tion that must not be allowed to continue. Justice Joyce Abdulma- lik who delivered the Federal high court judgment had last year issued an or- der that the presentation of the 2024 budget by Fubara before a 4-member Rivers House of Assembly was an affront to the Constitutional provision. Specifically, the Judge had said that Fubara\u2019s ac- tion in implementing un- lawful budget smacked gross violations of the 1999 Constitution he swore to protect. The judge had therefore restrained CBN, Accoun- tant General of the Fed- eration, Zenith Bank, and Access Bank from further allowing Fubara to access money from the Consoli- dated Revenue and Feder- ation Account.", "summary": "Share\u2026orders pro-Wike lawmakers to resume immediately The Supreme Court yesterday ordered that no money shall be re- leased to the Rivers State government until a lawful Appropriation Law is enacted under the Martin Amaewhule Speakership, further puting more pressure on Governor Simina- laya Fubara.

Your ability to spend within your budget will help you to rectify past financial mistakes. \n\nEvaluate Your Expenses \n\nWriting down your budget is the easiest part of budgeting but following it and making adjustments where necessary so as not to exceed it is the most onerous task. \n\nBut then, the actual work and victory come when you start to track your expenses and modify it as necessary. \n\nYou can also use budget software tracking as long as you keep up with checking your daily transactions. \n\nYou may also switch to the envelope system of budgeting if you are not convenient with the software tracking. \n\nBesides, it is mainly a cash-only budget where you pay cash for your categories such as groceries and entertainment. \n\nThe way the envelope system functions is that at the start of a new month, you will put the money you have budgeted for each items or category in an envelope and when you run out of cash, you stop spending. \n\nBy that, you are adhering strictly to your budget. \n\nDiscuss Your Budget \n\nThis is crucial for married couples if they truly want to succeed financially.

And once you have paid off the first debt, you will use the money you were paying towards it and add it to the payments on the second debt. \n\nJust continue rolling the amount over until you have cleared all outstanding debts. \n\nYou also need to work very hard to make extra money to pay all your debts as this would enable you to have financial peace of mind. \n\nStay Out Of Debt \n\nMake up your mind to stay out of debt especially if you desire to experience financial freedom. \n\nThere is no point to fix your financial problems if you continually go into debt each month.

To Curb Crime, Violence\u00a0", "text": "The Nigerian Police Force has called for a collaborative effort in fighting crimes in communities so as to ensure that everyone lives, works and thrives without fear of crime, violence or insecurity. \n\nACP Tanaruno Folashade, the Agbara Area Commander in Ogun State made the call while speaking at the Mega Security seminar and patrons investiture of Police Community Relations Committee (PCRC) Ambassador State Unit in Igbesa with the theme: \u2018Zero Tolerance for crimes, criminalities & Insecurities in our communities\u2019. \n\nShe said that the Police, alongside other security agencies and community partners, is dedicated to enforcing a zero-tolerance policy towards crimes, criminal activities, and insecurities in the neighborhood . \n\nShe said that the proliferation of crimes, criminalities, and insecurities in our communities poses a significant threat to the safety, well-being, and quality of life of citizens. \n\nAccording to her, crime is a complex issue with economic, political, and social aspects and that it encompasses offences such as theft, domestic violence, rape, defilement, armed robbery, murder, kidnapping, banditry, terrorism, cybercrime, financial fraud, drug trafficking, human trafficking, corruption among others which can have devastating effects on individuals, families, and communities. \n\nShe noted that insecurities, such as fear of crime and social unrest, can also undermine community cohesion and trust. \n\n\u201cThese criminal acts pose serious threats to national stability, investor confidence, and the well-being of citizens.\u201d \n\nShe called on all stakeholders, security agencies, community leaders, businesses, and citizens to adopt a zero-tolerance stance on crime, stressing that a zero-tolerance policy sends a strong message that crimes will not be tolerated, thereby deterring potential offenders. \n\nWhile speaking on the causes of crimes and insecurities, Tanaruno pointed out that a lack of economic opportunities often drives individuals toward criminal behavior, also when criminals evade justice, it encourages them to persist in their activities. \n\nSpeaking further she said despite the ongoing efforts to reduce crime, there are still several challenges in achieving zero tolerance for crime, such according to her include: limited manpower where she said that the ratio of police officers to citizens in Nigeria falls short of international standards, that there is a need for more officers to be recruited. \n\nAlso, Dr. Samson Popoola, the PCRC State Chairman in his lecture said a zero tolerance approach to crime, criminality, and insecurity in communities typically emphasises strict enforcement of laws and immediate consequences for criminal activities. \n\nPopoola, who was represented at the event by Comrade Sanmi Ogundele said that a zero tolerance approach to crime can include harsh penalties for criminal behaviour, as well as a focus on law enforcement presence and proactive strategies for preventing crime. \n\n\u201cWhile this approach might reduce crime in the short term, it is important to balance it with social support programs, rehabilitation efforts, and community engagement to address root causes of crime such as poverty, lack of education, and social inequality. \n\n\u201cStrong community partnerships with law enforcement can help foster trust and reduce the underlying factors that contribute to criminal behaviour.\u201d \n\nHe said that it is essential to invest in education and after-school programs to help steer young people away from crime that communities can provide mentorship, skill development, and support systems to break cycles of poverty and criminal behaviour before they even start. \n\n\u201cA zero-tolerance policy can work better when paired with community policing, which focuses on building relationships between law enforcement and local residents,\u201d he said. \n\nPopoola said that for those already involved in criminal activity, offering rehabilitation programs, mental health support, and job training can help break the cycle of crime. \n\nDr. Adeyeye Felix, PCRC Ambassador state unit Coordinator, earlier in his welcome address said that the event is a testament to their unwavering commitment to fostering an environment where everyone can live,

A new study shows how these differences manifest themselves in the structure of the brain.Schizophrenia is a complex mental health condition that affects perception, thought and emotions. This complexity is reflected in the individual manifestations of the disease: for some patients, perceptual disturbances are the main problem, while for others, cognitive impairments are more prevalent. \u201cIn this sense, there is not one schizophrenia, but many, each with different neurobiological profiles,\u201d says Wolfgang Omlor, first author of the study and senior physician at the University Hospital of Psychiatry Zurich.Data was collected by comparing the brain structures of several thousand patients with schizophrenia and healthy individuals, the variability of brain structure could be studied with a high degree of reliability.While variable brain structures in schizophrenia may reflect differences in symptoms between patients, the uniformity of brain folding in the mid-frontal brain area suggests a developmental trait common to people with schizophrenia. Because brain folding is largely completed in early childhood, brain development during this period appears to be less flexible in schizophrenia patients, particularly in areas responsible for linking thinking and feeling processes.While uniform brain folding may indicate possible mechanisms of disease development, regions with high variability in brain structure may be relevant for the development of individualized treatment strategiesRef: Mancini V, Latreche C, Fanshawe JB, Varvari I, Zauchenberger C-Z, McGinn N, et al.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), in particular, affects over a quarter of the world\u2019s population. In addition, it is closely linked to diabetes, obesity, and metabolic disorders, and constitutes a major risk for severe complications, including liver cancer and cardiovascular disease. While alcohol consumption and obesity are established risk factors for colorectal cancer (CRC), a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality, mounting evidence supports the association between NAFLD and CRC. Hence, a research team led by Dr. Takefumi Kimura from the Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Japan, along with Dr. Nobuharu Tamaki from Musashino Red Cross Hospital, Japan and Dr. Shun-Ichi Wakabayashi from Shinshu University School of Medicine, Japan, conducted a nationwide population-based study to compare the risk and incidence of CRC across patients with SLD. Their study was published online in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. The study included patients with SLD and individuals without known liver disease for comparative analyses. The incidence and risk of CRC were compared among the SLD subgroups. It was observed that 0.19% of patients were diagnosed with CRC over the 4.5-year follow-up period. In addition, the risk of CRC varied significantly among patients with SLD, with the highest CRC risk observed in patients with ALD, followed by MetALD and MASLD. The study highlights differences in CRC risk across patients with different subgroups of SLD, underscoring the need for comprehensive CRC screening and risk stratification based on the new consensus-based definitions of liver disease. The differences in CRC risk across the different subgroups may be attributed to their underlying pathology and interactions with other comorbidities. Mechanistically, alcohol may trigger CRC development through the production of toxic metabolites, oxidative stress, and DNA damage. MASLD/NAFLD, on the other hand, is associated with increased inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and insulin resistance, which in turn, elevates the risk of CRC.Ref: Colorectal Cancer Incidence in Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD, MetALD, and ALD), Kimura, Takefumi et al.

If you head away from the coast and most of the tourists, inland, you\u2019ll discover some amazing river beaches. \n\n\"My favourites are Praia Fluvial do Pego Fundo in Alcoutim, and Praia Fluvial de Alte in Alte.\"\n\nJack said: \"For a perfect beach day, take a short boat ride to Tavira Island, where you\u2019ll find pristine sandy shores and crystal-clear waters. \n\n\"Spend your time lounging on the beach, swimming in the gentle waves, or enjoying a romantic sunset walk.\" The island's serene environment is perfect for unwinding and reconnecting away from the hustle and bustle.\"\n\nBudget attractions worth visiting\n\nIn\u00eas said: \"Try out the local markets in Loul\u00e9, Olh\u00e3o and Portim\u00e3o to find the freshest local produce and fish in the region. Products arrive daily and are quickly sold out, so it's best to visit early in the morning.\n\n\"Alternatively, hiking is the best way to explore Algarve\u2019s natural landscape and admire how rich and diverse it is - I recommend Seven Hanging Valleys, Waterfall Trail and Ponta da Carrapateira Trail. \n\n\"Or for a different experience, pack your lunch and go on a picnic in the countryside around Monchique, Salir, Alte, Queren\u00e7a or Alcoutim.\" \n\nAna said: \"The Algar Seco is a stunning area of natural rock formations, and it's free to explore its caves, stacks and pathways.\" \n\nAngela said: \"Silves is an amazing city and from August 9-17 they have a medieval festival in the evenings, with lots of handicraft stalls, music, food and drinks.\"\n\nBest place to go for a couple's retreat\n\nAna said: \"Tavira is a beautiful small town in the east Algarve. Its charm lies in its slow flowing river, cobble stoned streets, and picturesque bridges. \n\n\"This atmosphere blended with historic architecture, intimate dining options, and a few luxury hotels and resorts, makes it the perfect destination for couples.\"\n\nAngela said: \"I would recommend the quaint resort of Alvor, an hour's transfer from the airport - it's typically Portuguese with the picturesque cobbled streets. \n\n\"It\u2019s a more laid back resort with bars, restaurants and fine dining.\"\n\nMust-do activities\n\nIn\u00eas said: Take a boat tour to Benagil Cave and Praia da Marinha or Ponta da Piedade \u2013 these are the most visited natural landmarks in the Algarve. Not visiting them is the same as going to Paris and not seeing the Eiffel Tower.\n\n\"Make sure you do some oyster tasting, as the best oysters in Portugal come from the Algarve, and also some wine tasting - when compared with Alentejo or Douro wines, Algarvian wines are much sweeter and slightly more alcoholic.\n\n\"Spend the day at Ilha Deserta. Although it\u2019s a popular location, Ilha Deserta is one of the most isolated coastal areas in the Algarve and perfect for a quiet day enjoying the sun.\" \n\nAna said: \"From a simple day on the beach, to hiking on the cliffs. There\u2019s multiple boat activities; dolphin watching in their natural environment off the coast in the Algarve is one of the best for all ages! For food tourists, the algarve has several wineries and vineyards that make excellent slower days. Or you can visit the more traditional side of rural life and explore olive oil production, and even orange tree farming. \n\nJack said: \"Visiting the islands from Olh\u00e3o is a must-do experience when exploring the Algarve. \n\n\"This charming coastal town serves as a gateway to the stunning Ria Formosa Natural Park, a sprawling lagoon system dotted with idyllic islands.\"\n\nFavourite bars\n\nIn\u00eas said: \"In Portim\u00e3o, Bolan in Alvor is a chilled, family-owned bar that serves the best capirinhas, while NoSolo \u00c1gua has a pool lounge overlooking the beach in Praia da Rocha that serves sushi and oysters. \n\n\"In Ferragudo, head to Club Nau on Sundays to enjoy live music and a few cocktails, for views over Praia Grande at sunset (cocktails from \u20ac6).\" \n\nAna said: The LAB Terrace sunset bar is my favourite bar in Faro - the atmosphere is very relaxed, the drinks are excellent and fairly priced (beers from \u20ac2 and wines from \u20ac4.50). \n\n\"The views are stunning, with the most beautiful sunsets over the Ria Formosa lagoon.\"\n\nAngela said: \"Pedro's bar on the beach in Arma\u00e7\u00e3o de Pera is good for a cocktail (house wine from \u20ac3.50 and cocktails from \u20ac7).\"\n\nBest place to go for outdoors adventurers\n\nIn\u00eas said: \"For outdoor adventurers, there is no better place than Monchique, for its hiking trails and birdwatching, medicinal water thermal baths, and yoga retreats.\" \n\nAna said: \"Lagos is a brilliant town that has long attracted surfers to the west Algarve, but recently has become a prime destination for visitors of all types. \n\n\"It has incredible hiking trails, water and beach sports, and a historic old town to explore, plus its proximity to the west Algarve is great for explorers that want to see the wild coastline with cliffs and big waves.\" \n\nVerity said: \"Head to Baloi\u00e7o Panor\u00e2mico do Pico Alto for a swing on the mountains with a picturesque view of the Algarve, and Fonte F\u00e9rrea has a pretty waterfall and open water area close to the mountains.\" \n\nJack said: \"If you're into surfing, then in the summer months you need to visit the west coast. \n\n\"Monte Clerigo and Arrifana beaches are both based near the bigger town of Aljezur, and all three locations offer great accommodation and dining options to accompany the stunning waves. \n\n\"If the waves aren\u2019t working that day, then you can always go for an amazing cliff-front walk and explore the area that way, and make sure to stop by Arte Bianca for an amazing pizza if you're in the area.\" \n\nFavourite viewpoints\n\nIn\u00eas said: \"Alcoutim is an authentic countryside village overlooking the Guadiana River, where you can admire the river view while crossing the border to Spain on a zip line.\" \n\nAna said: \"A view point I always go back to is in Cacela Velha, a tiny village with a view of the Ria Formosa, an expansive beach, and the coast. \n\n\"Alternatively, Sagres, formally known as the \u2018End of the Known World\u2019 offers jaw dropping views with its huge cliffs and Atlantic waves breaking on the beaches below.\"\n\nAngela said: \"Pria da Rocha, the resort at Portimao, has fantastic views along the coastline and it\u2019s also a great resort to visit with its boardwalk on the beach lined with bars and restaurants.\" \n\nSalem said: \"One of my favourite view points is Porto Mos Beach, if you walk up the cliffs at sunset.\" \n\nBest place to take kids\n\nVerity: ParTee Mini Golf Vale do Lobo, Zoomarine, Aquashow, Lagos Zoo or any of the waterparks. There is also a Safari park in Aljezur.\n\nJack: One thing I LOVE to do with my nieces and nephews is visit Slide & Splash water park in Lagoa. I highly recommend booking a day here as they have slides suitable for all ages, and a safe, comfortable environment to all relax in together.\n\nPlaces that are overrated or tourist traps\n\nIn\u00eas said: \"Praia da Rocha. The beach is one of the best in the Portim\u00e3o area, you barely get any waves and you\u2019ll find all the necessary facilities, from restaurants and bars to restrooms, sunbeds, outdoor gym, and a sports area. \n\n\"However, if you look over to the shoreline all you\u2019ll see are apartment towers and hotels, tacky bars and pubs, and souvenir shops.\"\n\nAna said: \"Albufeira is the original Algarve resort town with stunning beaches, but it's too touristy and too overdeveloped. You have to look hard to find an authentic and local experience.\" \n\nVerity said: \"Vilamoura Marina and Quarteira are quite touristy, so they won't give you the true Algarve experience. But they also have some new restaurants, so the vibe is slowly changing.\" \n\nTips for tourists \n\nAna said: \"The Algarve suffers serious seasonality, the summer months - June to August are saturated. If you can, visit in late September and October, when the temperatures are still warm enough for the beaches.\" \n\nAngela said: \"Hire a car to reach the hidden beaches and coves stretching the whole of the Algarvian peninsula, from Tavira right down to Sagres.\" \n\nVerity said: \"Avoid the old towns or centres during July and August if you don\u2019t like crowds, and prepare for customs control to take a while if you\u2019re coming with a non-EU passport. \n\n\"Bring your sunscreen, as it can get pricey here, and ask which fish has been caught locally. \" \n\nJack said: \"Hop on a ferry or if you\u2019re a larger group, hire a private boat tour to reach the tranquil islands of Culatra, Armona, and Farol.\n\n\"Each island offers its own unique charm, from the pristine beaches and traditional fishing villages to the vibrant marine life and scenic walking trails.\" \n\nWhere to stay\n\nIn\u00eas said: \"Aldeia de Pedralva is a rebuilt, formerly abandoned traditional countryside village near Lagos. You can stay at one of the refurbished houses, go cycling or hiking in the countryside and still be close to the beach.\n\n\"Or the Bela Vista Hotel & Spa \u2013 Relais & Ch\u00e2teaux in Portim\u00e3o is a beautiful boutique hotel set in a 19th palace overlooking Praia da Rocha.\"\n\nAna said: \"If you are looking for a unique and luxurious stay in the Algarve, I recommend the hotels from Pousadas de Portugal. \n\nThey are small luxury hotels built in historic buildings, so you not only get the 5-star hotel experience, but you also have unique access to some historical palaces and monuments in the Algarve. \n\n\"In Est\u00f3i, you have Pousada Pal\u00e1cio de Est\u00f3i, an 18th century Neoclassical palace located 10 km from Faro, and in Tavira, Pousada Convento Tavira is built inside a former 16th century convent.\"\n\nJack said: \"For a quiet stay, head to Budens, Salema, or Figueira and enjoy the village beach life. \n\n\"On the western side of the south coast, these locations are a little further from the airport but enjoy a quieter, more relaxed way of living away from any high rises.\"", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/travel/14416741/locals-best-algarve-tips-beaches-restaurants-hotels-attractions/", "image": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/newspress-collage-x1fwfgd9q-1740662089748.jpg?1740816397&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 08:01:00", "author": "Katrina Turrill", "authors": ["Katrina Turrill"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.838}, {"id": 295575668, "title": "Map reveals UK\u2019s most congested areas where traffic is bumper-to-bumper \u2013 do you live near a road-going nightmare?", "text": "THE UK\u2019S most congested areas where you\u2019re highly likely to get stuck in traffic have been revealed - with Surrey taking the top spot.\n\nThe new research, which was calculated by looking at the total volume of all vehicle traffic miles, the number of licensed vehicles, and the annual average daily flow of traffic in 2023, shows the places across the country that are particularly frustrating for drivers.\n\nExperts at traffic plan software Traffic Chart gave each factor a score out of 10 and an overall score out of 100;

My son Jasper, two, is living the dream. Life is remarkably simple. \n\nThis was far from our reality back in the UK, where I couldn\u2019t even get a visa for my German husband to live with us. \n\nDespite Julius having a British-born baby, being gainfully employed and primed to pay British taxes, he didn\u2019t qualify \u2013 such is the tomfoolery of our immigration system. \n\nSimply put, the year we applied my income wasn\u2019t high enough (unsurprisingly given I am freelance and was on maternity leave having just had a baby) and the government doesn\u2019t take into account the foreign applicant\u2019s earnings. \n\nSo never mind that Julius was the breadwinner, it was a \u2018hard no\u2019 to him living legally in England with his family. \n\nI consulted several lawyers and got the same response from all of them. \n\nIn order to qualify, I\u2019d have to go back to the office, leave my six-week old son in the care of a nursery, and put up with his father living in a different country for at least a year so that I could prove I \u2018earned enough\u2019 for him to join us. \n\nFirst of all, I \u2013 like many parents \u2013 never fancied the idea of strangers raising my infant. And secondly, I wasn\u2019t willing to pay an extortionate sum of money for the privilege. \n\nThe UK is, after all, one of the most expensive countries in the world for childcare, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). \n\nIn many areas of our nation, the monthly cost of having a child in nursery exceeds a family\u2019s mortgage payments. \n\nThat is absurd. In Mauritius, our local nursery \u2013 which by all accounts is excellent \u2013 costs \u00a3150 per month for five days a week, 8am-noon. \n\nIn London, a part-time nursery place will set you back up to \u00a3872 a month. \n\nIn April we are moving to Italy, so you can imagine my shock when, upon enquiring how much the charming village nursery there would charge, they informed me it was free, for a full-time place. \n\nI can leave him there as long or as little as I want every day and the only cost is lunch, if I don\u2019t provide it. \n\nPersonally, I won\u2019t be putting our son in nursery for more than four hours a day in Italy, for the same reason we have a part-time nanny here at home in Mauritius to help out so I can work for a portion of the day. \n\nAnd that\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to miss out on these crucial first years of his life. \n\nIt was heartbreaking watching my peers back in the UK having to leave their babies with childminders and turn their attention back to full-time careers most of them weren\u2019t even passionate about, just to afford the household bills.\n\nThe UK government likes to blame all sorts of factors for its less-than-ideal circumstances these daysAnnabel Fenwick Elliott\n\nThis may sound anti-feminist, but I truly life would be better for everyone if families didn\u2019t, as was the case several generations ago, have to rely on dual incomes; and if the women who didn\u2019t have a burning desire to climb the corporate ladder (of which there are plenty) could stay at home guilt-free and raise their children without facing financial hardship.\n\nThe UK government likes to blame all sorts of factors for its less-than-ideal circumstances these days, but it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. \n\nI\u2019ve found proof in other countries. \n\nGranted, moving so much hasn\u2019t been easy so we\u2019re certainly planning to settle in Italy, but it\u2019s been worth it. \n\nOf all the British expats I\u2019ve come to know in the past few years, not one regrets leaving Blighty.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/fabulous/14416752/mum-left-uk-raise-son-mauritius/", "image": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/newspress-collage-9ceq28303-1740756419869.jpg?1740816724&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 08:06:20", "author": "Annabel Fenwick Elliott,Martha Cliff", "authors": ["Annabel Fenwick Elliott", "Martha Cliff"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.233}, {"id": 295575666, "title": "Luke \u2018the Dingo\u2019 Trembath dead at 38: Snowboarder dies as Tony Hawk and Avril Lavigne lead tributes", "text": "TRIBUTES poured in for Australian snowboarder Luke Trembath after he tragically passed away aged 38.\n\nAs news of Trembath\u2019s death broke, friends and colleagues shared their shock on social media.\n\nSinger Avril Lavigne, skateboard legend Tony Hawk and UFC ring girl Brittney Palmer were among those to pay tribute to \"Dingo.\" \n\nHawk wrote: \"Words cannot describe the joy this guy brought to every gathering. \n\n\"His laughter was magically contagious, and he revered our culture because he was shaped by it.\n\n\"Thank you Dingo for being The Great Connector in our fragmented world.

What should I do?\n\nMy wife and I are both in our mid-30s and tied the knot five years ago.\n\nLately, our sex life has gone off the boil. She wants to try for a baby and I\u2019m not ready.\n\nSo now, every time we have sex, she makes me feel guilty about using a condom. It\u2019s not fun or exciting any more.\n\nSometimes, the only way I can climax is if I fantasise about other women. In December, my wife and I went to a big family Christmas at her parents\u2019 house in the countryside.\n\nThe whole family was there \u2014 her grandparents, siblings, aunts, uncles and cousins.\n\nThey\u2019d all come to our wedding, apart from one cousin, who was away travelling on her gap year at the time.\n\nShe\u2019s now 23 and gorgeous. When she walked into the room, I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off her.\n\nOver the few days we were there, I spent a lot of time chatting to her.\n\nShe and I stayed up later than everyone else, drinking and having a laugh.\n\nAnd, unless I\u2019m imagining it, she was quite flirty.\n\nAfterwards, I\u2019d climb into bed with my wife, we\u2019d have sex and I\u2019d imagine I was with her cousin instead.\n\nIf anything, my fantasies have been getting stronger since we came home. She even features in my dreams.\n\nIt makes me feel guilty, like I\u2019ve been cheating \u2014 even though I haven\u2019t.\n\nDoes this mean anything? What should I do?\n\nDEIDRE SAYS: Fantasies and sexy dreams are common and harmless \u2013 so long as you don\u2019t act on them.\n\nYou know rationally that you can\u2019t have a relationship with your wife\u2019s cousin, even if she were interested in you.\n\nIt\u2019s not just because you\u2019re married. It\u2019s also the fact she\u2019s so much younger and she\u2019s a relative.\n\nGetting involved with her would tear your wife\u2019s family apart.\n\nBut it sounds like you love your wife and have no desire to cheat with her cousin, or anyone else.\n\nThe issue is that her desire for a baby, when you\u2019re not ready, has adversely affected your sex life and created a gulf between you, which your fantasies have rushed in to fill.\n\nYou need to talk to her about this and try to get things back on track.\n\nMy support pack, Looking After Your Relationship, should help.\n\nThe fantasies will probably fade away on their own over time.\n\nTHANK YOU FOR... THE STRENGTH TO FIX MY MARRIAGE\n\nDEAR DEIDRE: WHEN my husband and I updated our wills, it caused a huge rift between us.\n\nI said I wanted my half of our house to go to my biological children, but he said it should be split between all our kids equally. We argued and he became nasty and insulting. \n\nI felt it had damaged our relationship and I wasn\u2019t sure we could repair it.\n\nWe\u2019ve been married for 20 years and have three children together. He also has a son from his first marriage.\n\nI wrote to you asking if I was in the wrong and if we could fix things.\n\nYou said it would be a good idea if we had counselling, so we could discuss our issues in a safe environment with the help of someone impartial.\n\nYou were also concerned about my husband being nasty and sent me your Abusive Partner support pack, plus a Women\u2019s Aid questionnaire, to see if I might be in an abusive relationship.\n\nYour response gave me the push I needed to confront lots of things I was unhappy with. We cleared the air and my husband admitted that he was being unreasonable.\n\nIt was really cathartic and I feel much more positive. Thank you.\n\nDEIDRE SAYS: Communication is so important at every stage in a marriage. I\u2019m so glad you were able to talk this through productively.\n\nBROTHER\u2019S CRUDE KIDS NEED TO LEARN MANNERS\n\nDEAR DEIDRE: MY brother\u2019s kids swear like troopers and have no boundaries.\n\nThey\u2019re turning into little brats and I feel like I should say something, but I don\u2019t want to create a family fallout.\n\nMy brother and his wife have three children, all between the ages of six and ten. I\u2019m his big sister, aged 45.\n\nThey\u2019re loving, caring parents in many ways, but they don\u2019t moderate their language. Of course, children repeat what they hear. They also talk about genitalia and say things I find blasphemous.\n\nI know young kids find toilet humour amusing, but they discuss these things far more than most. It\u2019s so inappropriate.\n\nTheir table manners are terrible, too. They throw food, don\u2019t seem to know how to use a knife and fork properly and use their tablets at meal times.\n\nI worry how they\u2019ll cope in the world when they\u2019re older if they don\u2019t know how to behave. I love my nephews and niece, and get on well with my brother, but I\u2019m feeling increasingly uncomfortable about the way he\u2019s bringing up his kids.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s my place to say anything. My brother probably won\u2019t take it well. Should I just grin and bear it?\n\nDEIDRE SAYS: This is a delicate situation. You\u2019re an auntie, not a teacher. If you say anything, your brother and his wife could take it as an uninvited criticism of their parenting.\n\nThey could respond by shooting the messenger \u2013 you \u2013 rather than changing their approach or disciplining their children.\n\nBear in mind kids will also pick up bad language outside the home, from the playground, TV and the media.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s best to try a gentle approach. If, for instance, they\u2019re at your house, you could say, \u201cWe don\u2019t say words like that here\u201d.\n\nFor help with parenting issues, contact familylives.org.uk (0808 800 2222).\n\nUNRELIABLE FRIEND GHOSTS ME\n\nDEAR DEIDRE: I\u2019M wondering whether I should drop a fairweather friend who has let me down many times.\n\nHe\u2019s very unreliable and tends to ghost me when I need him.\n\nI\u2019m 35 and he\u2019s 36. We\u2019ve been mates since college.\n\nHe\u2019s great company and a lot of fun \u2013 the type of pal it\u2019s great to go out drinking or on holiday with.\n\nBut when I\u2019m down or upset about something, he is never there for me.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want to talk about my feelings or comfort me \u2013 even though I was there for him when he split up with his long-term girlfriend.\n\nI don\u2019t expect him to have any solutions, I just want to feel he cares.\n\nSometimes, I won\u2019t hear from him for months and he\u2019ll ignore my messages. Then he\u2019ll pop back up again wanting to go for a pint.\n\nI\u2019m loath to end our friendship because I\u2019ve known him for almost 20 years \u2013 and he isn\u2019t a bad person. What should I do?\n\nDEIDRE SAYS: He may not be a bad person, but he\u2019s not being a good friend.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s not because he doesn\u2019t care or is superficial, but because he finds it hard to talk about feelings, or worries he can\u2019t help.\n\nThe fact you\u2019re writing suggests you don\u2019t want to end the friendship.\n\nSo you need to sit down over a drink and be honest about how you feel.\n\nMy support pack, Standing Up For Yourself, should help you have this conversation.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/dear-deidre/14416708/fantasising-sex-wifes-hot-cousin/", "image": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/passionate-young-couple-underwear-kissing-971103678.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 07:59:54", "author": "Laura Goddard,Sally Land", "authors": ["Laura Goddard", "Sally Land"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.01}, {"id": 295575654, "title": "Presenter gives co-host death stare after major UK Open draw blunder as ITV forced to defend result", "text": "DARTS fans demanded a redraw after the UK Open draw descended into chaos. \n\nBecause by the end there was still a ball left in the bowl.\n\nCompere John McDonald was overseeing proceedings for the fifth-round draw of the 'FA Cup of darts' in Minehead live on ITV4.\n\nBut there was confusion after the very first tie came out.\n\nRyan Searle was pitted against Luke Humphries in the opening pairing.\n\nBut after picking out Humphries' No23 ball, journalist Ned Boulting inexplicably put it back into the drum - instead of on the stand. \n\nWith that, the already-drawn number was mixed back in with the other 30 left.\n\nMcDonald immediately pointed out the error to Boulting and admonished him as he seemingly tried to dig out No23 again.\n\nBut before he could try and do so, McDonald made sure he left it in the bowl - then gave his colleague an almighty death stare.\n\nAnd crucially, the draw was allowed to continue. \n\nCASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO BONUSES FROM \u00a310 DEPOSITS\n\nIncredibly, in a freak twist, the No23 was not picked out again as the remaining 30 balls were drawn.\n\nAnd at the end of the draw, the No23 ball remained rolling around at the bottom of the bowl as McDonald confirmed the conclusion - before immediately turning to talk to Boulting again. \n\nSpeaking on ITV, presenter Jacqui Oatley quickly addressed the blunder but confirmed: \"It's okay, the draw was totally legitimate.\"\n\nHowever, darts supporters watching the draw unfold could not believe it was allowed to stand. \n\nOne tweeted: \"Dodgy UK Open draw there\u2026. how is there a ball left in the drum?\"\n\nAnother wrote: \"Pretty certain a mix up with the UK Open darts draw.

Your focus needs to be on keeping the cold out \u2013 and the warmth in.\u201d\n\nAs we reported previously, you can check for any draughts using toilet paper.\n\nHaving located any gaps, you then need to take action to plug them.\n\nMartyn said: \u201cMy first tip is to buy a roll of weather-stripping. You can get this online, or from your local DIY store, and it works a treat. For me this is a bit of a no-brainer.\u201d\n\nYou can pick up six metres of draught-proofing strips on Amazon for as little as \u00a34.99. To apply, simply clean the surface and measure carefully before cutting strips to size. Peel off the backing and then press each one firmly along the door or frame, making sure you\u2019ve got a tight seal.\n\nMartyn\u2019s next tip to banish draughts involves investing in another low-cost gizmo.\n\nHe said: \u201cGet your hands on a draught excluder to go along the bottom of your door. This will block cold air from entering and warm air from escaping.\u201d\n\nAt the likes of B&M, Wilko and The Range you can pick one up for under a tenner.\n\nBetter still, if you don\u2019t want to shell out at all, you can fashion your own excluder from items you already have around the home. \n\nTry stuffing rags into one of the legs from an old pair of tights, or placing old towels at the base of your doors.\n\nMartyn said: \u201cBlocking out draughts is an easy way to make savings on your energy costs. It could help you cut your bills by \u00a340 a year \u2013 while also making your property warm and snug.\u201d\n\nAs we reported previously, you might want to try applying window film to single-glazed windows to create an additional layer of insulation \u2013 or you might want to try using caulk to fill gaps that cause draughts.\n\nAnother small change put forward by Martyn \u2013 which won\u2019t cost you a penny \u2013 is being diligent about remembering to close doors. \n\nThe energy-saving pro said: \u201cThis is especially important in rooms with external facing walls. Shutting doors prevents the warm air from being cooled down \u2013 reducing the need to have the heating on.\u201d\n\nDealing with draughts isn\u2019t the only hack that Martyn suggests to try and help keep a lid on energy expenses.\n\nThe home heating supremo also recommends making use of your \u2018thermostatic radiator valves\u2019. If you need to replace faulty ones, you can get a two-pack on Amazon for around \u00a310. \n\n(If, however, you need to start from scratch, each valve and thermostatic head will cost around \u00a320 \u2013 and you would also need an installer to fit them for you.)\n\nTRVs, as they are known, automatically reduce the flow of hot water from your boiler to the radiator once your room is at its desired temperature. \n\nThis can help lower the amount of gas your boiler needs to heat your central heating system.\n\nAs a guide, you should look to set your TRV to 2 or 3 in the average room. If you don't need to heat a room, set your TRV on the lowest setting.\n\nMartyn said: \u201cBetter still, look into installing a robust set of controls, including a programmer and a thermostat \u2013 as well as TRVs.\u201d\n\nThis combination of measures could save you up to \u00a3110 a year, according to the Energy Saving Trust.\n\n\u201cFor even more assurance, why not install a smart thermostat,\u201d said Martyn. \n\n\u201cOne of these devices is connected to an app, turning your phone into a remote control \u2013 allowing you to manage your home heating from anywhere.\u201dYou can, he adds, then think about controlling your heating zonally.\n\n\u201cThis ensures you\u2019re paying to only heat the rooms you need to,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother simple hack from the energy-saving aficionado involves lowering the flow temperature from the boiler to the radiators.\n\n\u201cIf you have a combi boiler, then this can help you lower energy consumption,\u201d he said.\n\n \u201cA rule of thumb to follow is to set the flow temperature as low as you can so that it heats your home comfortably \u2013 and in a reasonable amount of time.\u201d\n\nJust bear in mind that this can change from season to season. \n\nMartyn said: \u201cRemember to change the flow temperature accordingly to ensure you aren\u2019t using unnecessary energy in the warmer months.\u201d\n\nWhen the warmer days of spring do eventually arrive, another simple tip is hang washing outside to dry.\n\n\u201cIf you can avoid using a tumble dryer, you could save \u00a350 a year,\u201d said Martyn. \n\n\u201cAnd while you\u2019re at it, when doing your laundry, try reducing your washes to one run per week on a 30-degree cycle.

You're gambling with World War Three.\"\n\nA scheduled press conference was cancelled and Zelensky was forced to leave the White House with no minerals deal.\n\nTrump said Zelensky was \"not in a place to negotiate\".\n\nDespite the fierce clash, Zelensky said his relationship with the President could be fixed but added he wanted Trump \"more at our side\" after the commander-in-chief said he wanted to be in the middle.\n\nIn his post White House interview, he later thanked Trump, Congress, and the American people for their support and said he was \"ready for peace\".\n\nIn a follow-up statement, Trump told Zelensky: \u201cHe can come back when he is ready for Peace.\n\n\u201cI have determined that President Zelensky is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want advantage, I want PEACE.\u201d\n\nEUROPE REACTS \n\nEuropean support for Zelensky is continuing to pour out of capitals on Friday night following the row.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said: \"Russia is the aggressor, Ukraine is the victim of aggression.\n\n\"I think we were all right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago and to continue to do so.\"\n\nDonald Tusk, the PM of Poland, said on X: \"Dear@ZelenskyyUa, dear Ukrainian friends, you are not alone.\"\n\nSweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson posted on X saying: \"Sweden stands with Ukraine.

It screamed Scotland, with Highland cows and tartan in every nook, but somehow managed to stay on the classy side of kitsch.\n\nOut in the garden was the aforementioned hot tub, which got plenty of use, even with the snow falling.\n\nArriving late afternoon, we got ourselves settled in before heading out for dinner at the nearby Aspects Restaurant, part of the Macdonald Resort.\n\nSomething of an institution in the town, they really know how to look after diners, bringing us still warm, home-made rolls and butter while we perused the menu.\n\nI went for the crayfish and prawn cocktail, which was fresh and delicious, before tucking into a crisp chicken Kiev, which was a moreish treat. Meanwhile, my husband Ryan went for the Indian options, trying the King Prawn Pepper Fry and the slow cooked lamb rogan josh, the latter so tender it fell off the bone.\n\nAnd our five-year-old son Jimmy, who has food allergies, couldn\u2019t have been better catered for, polishing off three massive courses of melon, sausages and sorbet in jig time.\n\nThe next day we\u2019d scheduled a day of activities at Loch Insh Outdoor Centre where our expert guide Dale put us through our paces.\n\nThe stunning venue is right on the water and offers everything from wild swimming and sauna sessions to archery and watersports.We were booked in for tubing and it started to snow as we arrived which made the slope even slippier. \n\nThe squeals of delight as we hurtled down the hill in our giant inflatable rings could be heard bouncing off the hills - this really was a highlight of the trip.\n\nAfter a tasty lunch at the on-site cafe we were ready for more - this time it was a game of ice hockey on the all-year-round plastic rink. Brilliant fun.\n\nWe just had time for a wee dip in the hot tub back at base before venturing out for another fantastic meal, this time at the Old Bridge Inn. Highlights were my game terrine with fig and jalapeno chutney and Ryan\u2019s perfectly pink rib eye.\n\nA wee dram in front of the fire before bedtime was the perfect end to a hectic day.\n\nSaying goodbye to the adorable cottage was bittersweet - but we had more adventures ahead with a day at the fantastic Highland Wildlife Park planned. It\u2019s a winter wonderland in the snow, with so much to see from wolverines and snow monkeys to Polar Bears and Arctic foxes.\n\nIt was a fitting, wintry end to our Highland fling.\n\nAs we headed back to check if our own home\u2019s roof had survived the storm, we knew it would take a hurricane to keep us from returning to awesome Aviemore in the near future.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/travel/14400476/family-ski-holiday-wildlife/", "image": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/E46CEBjpg-JS971109338.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 08:03:01", "author": "Lynn Kernan", "authors": ["Lynn Kernan"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.526}, {"id": 295575650, "title": "\u2018Mind blown\u2019 people say as woman shares \u2018ultimate life hack\u2019 that makes drying sheets on an airer so much easier", "text": "BEDSHEETS can be a real nuisance when you're tackling the laundry - especially when it's too wet and miserable to hang them outside.\n\nThey often take up the entire clothes horse or get messily draped somewhere around the house in a desperate bid to get them to dry.\n\nAnd it can quickly become expensive to keep running the tumble dryer.\n\nWhich is apparently the most costly household appliance.\n\nOne TikTok user has blown people away with her genius hack - which is so simple yet effective it's left viewers \"mind blown.\"\n\nAnd better yet - it won't cost you a penny.\n\nPosting to her account, @2.elmo.4.u, the laundry pro shared a clever space-saving drying technique.\n\nHer video has racked up an impressive 9.9 million views so far, with people hurrying to give it a go themselves.\n\nIn her clip she can be seen pointing at her airer, which she's using to dry both her clothes and bedsheets.\n\nInstead of draping her sheet on the top of the dryer, she's cleverly stretched it underneath. \n\nSpeaking in German, she tells viewers: \"When you need to stretch bed sheets, just stretch them across here.\" \n\nAttaching one end of the sheet to either end of the dryer, she's left the bars on top free for drying her other items.\n\nShe goes on to say: \"Then you can still hang your stuff to dry here.\"\n\nShe neatly stacks her freshly washed shirts and socks on the bars above the bedsheet, with ample room for them to air out.\n\nThe clever hack effectively doubled the amount of space she had on her clothes horse and meant she didn't have to sacrifice the whole thing to her bedding.\n\nUsers react\n\nViewers in the comments couldn't believe her clever hack.\n\nOne person wrote: \"Oh my god, life changing.\"\n\nAnother person said: \"This is the ultimate life hack.\" \n\nSomeone else commented: \"Mind: BLOWN!\"\n\nWhile another user wrote: \"Game changer, omg.\"\n\nSomebody else commented: \"This is genius.\"", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/fabulous/14416779/laundry-dryer-airer-hack-washing-bedsheets/", "image": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/newspress-collage-d4qpf43df-1740411726457.jpg?1740817106&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 08:11:52", "author": "Rhiannon Oliver", "authors": ["Rhiannon Oliver"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.227}, {"id": 295575644, "title": "This Morning stars reveal their heartache over close friend\u2019s death as they share emotional tribute", "text": "THIS Morning stars have revealed their heartbreak over a close friend\u2019s death, and shared an emotional tribute.\n\nThe Speakmans, who are resident therapists on This Morning on ITV and helping viewers to face their fears and change their lives for the better, revealed that they\u2019ve lost a friend.\n\nNik and Eva Speakman took to social media to share a heartbreaking tribute to their friend Jean.\n\nThe couple shared a string of photos with her, and said their \u201chearts are broken\u201d as a result of their loss.\n\nNik and Eva\u2019s caption read: \u201cOur beautiful Jean\u2026\n\n\u201cEveryone that knows us well, has ever attended one of our full day workshops, or has attended one of our @traumaresearchuk charity balls, will have heard of, know of, or even have had the good fortune of meeting our dearest friends Matthew & Jean.\n\n\u201cOur hearts are broken to have had to say goodbye to Jean.

This girl already has nice lips and I've never, not once, even thought her lips were too small. In fact, they were already pretty nice!''\n\nDespite many assuming that a sweet baby voice may make you seem more cute and adorable, it actually has quite the opposite effect - and will send men running away from you.\n\nOne Redditor said: ''YES! It\u2019s so cringy whenever they say 'sowwy' instead of 'sorry'.''\n\nAnother revealed: ''I had a gf that did this to me when she'd really annoyed me. \n\n''I asked her if she had brain damage (I'm nothing if not subtle). That was the last time she tried that way to weedle out of some c**p she'd done.''\n\nMega 'caterpillar' eyelashes\n\nIf you've got a lash appointment booked in for this weekend and you're off to see your man afterwards, it may be worth calling your beauty tech to cancel.\n\nAmongst some of the biggest icks for men are ''absurd caterpillar eyelashes'', which one jokingly dubbed ''eyelid fur''.\n\n''Hell...gives me the ick as well when they're OTT [over the top],'' one falsie critic cried.\n\nAnother wondered: ''Who told women, that this looks good or that any man likes it. Don't they have mirror...?''\n\n'Ghastly long nails'\n\nMillions of women across the world fork out a fortune for their bi-weekly manicure appointments.\n\nBut turns out, not only could you save hundreds every year by ditching them - but also make your future hubby fall head over heels in love with you, as men seem to prefer natural nails instead of mega claws.\n\nOne person wrote: ''The super long claw nails just make me think of all the gunk stuck under there. Especially in cooking/eating imagery.''\n\nSomeone else agreed, writing: ''Highly impractical, and usually signaling for self-absorption.''\n\nTreating every occasion as a photoshoot \n\nMost of us like to upload a cheeky snap on Instagram or Facebook whenever we're all glammed up - but treating your man or potential love interest as a personal photographer gives the majority of blokes the dreaded ''ick''.\n\nA Redditor shared: ''I recently visited Santorini. One evening, I had dinner at a place overlooking a very popular spot with an amazing view of the island and the water.\n\n''I lost count of how many Insta girls dragged their dead-eyed boyfriends there and proceeded to cycle through two dozen look-at-me poses while whining photo instructions. \n\n''Treating people in your life like props or unpaid crew just so you can appear glamorous on social media is a major ick.''\n\nSincere belief in Astrology\n\nIt's the weekend and you're probably about to check our weekly horoscopes to see what the week ahead has in store for you - or perhaps you're big into tarot card reading.\n\nBut while you're busy reading what the next Mercury retrograde will look like, chances are your Tinder or Hinge match will be busy packing his bags to run away as soon as possible.\n\nOne man said: Hahahaha if you're wearing a 'healing' crystal or if I find Long Island Medium or John Edwards in any of your saved tv shows lists... I'm running away.''\n\nSomeone else chimed in: ''Astrology is very fun, but if you decide which PAIR OF SOCKS to buy on whether you're a Taurus or a Gemini, then I won't be hanging around for long.''\n\n'If he's under 6ft, I am not interested'\n\nAccording to research and general trends, most women tend to prefer men who are taller than them, suggesting that women generally do like tall men.\n\nThis preference is often attributed to evolutionary factors associating height with strength and protection.\n\nHowever, if you're constantly telling everyone your ideal man needs to be 6ft+, not only will you limit yourself to a smaller portion of candidates (the average height around the world is 5'7ft) but you'll also give Romeos ''the ick''.\n\nAs one man put it: ''When they say s**t like \u201cif he\u2019s under 6 foot or makes less than 100k a year I\u2019m not interested.\u201d\n\n''Ironically I am 6\u20192 and make over that, it\u2019s not about feeling secure it\u2019s just about being annoyed by idiocy.''\n\nSomeone else said: ''If you are 6' tall, in the United States, you are taller than 86.75% of the male population.\n\n''So you have taken the 13.25% of the men you will accept into even lower percentages than that. Those women don't know how to do math.''\n\nInstagram influencer look\n\nThere's no denying that thousands of Instagram influencers and models are beginning to look identical, and while many women don't enhance their faces for the male gaze, one thing seems clear - for men, that's a turn-off.\n\n''Clones with long straight hair, centre-part, duck face with caterpillar eyelashes and artifical mammaries is a thing,'' one Redditor wrote.\n\n''MEN want all natural women. BOYS want whatever a Kardashian is,'' a second added.\n\nBeing a devoted Swiftie\n\nShe's one of the leading artists on Spotify, with close to 90million monthly listeners and sold-out tours.\n\nBut American popstar Taylor Swift is not a major hit for thousands of men across the world - who see being a devoted Swiftie as a major ick.\n\n''Waiting weeks for buy a ticket in the street for Taylor swift.......(That happens in Barcelona),'' wrote one person from Spain.\n\nSomeone else agreed, adding: ''I am sick and tired of hearing about Taylor Swift. \n\n''I guess she sings, I don't know and I don't want to know.

"\u2018Easy to build and stylish,\u2019granny annexe owners chime after finding garden home for \u00a33.7k from Wayfair", "text": "FOR generations, the dream of homeownership meant climbing the property ladder - starting small and gradually working up to something bigger. \n\nBut with soaring house prices, high interest rates, and a growing demand for flexible living, more people are rethinking that traditional path.\n\nThis shift could explain the rise in granny annex purchases across Britain. \n\nA study by The London Economic revealed a 16% increase in online searches for properties featuring granny annexes, suggesting a growing public interest in alternative living spaces.\n\nFor those looking to buy, online retailers like Wayfair are making the process easier. \n\nCurrently, they offer a spacious summer granny annexe with double doors for \u00a33,699.99. \n\nDesigned to fit neatly at the end of a garden, this bright, open space is perfect for entertaining friends, hosting guests, or even creating an additional living area.\n\nWith an L-shaped design, a small terrace, and a canopy, the annexe is both practical and stylish. \n\nDouble-glazed, sealed windows and large glass doors make it ideal for the UK climate, extending the use of outdoor space even in cooler or rainy weather.\n\nThe set includes installation parts: a base frame, wall panels, floorboards, skirting, roof beams, mouldings, and hardware (handles, nails, and screws). \n\nHowever, roofing materials such as shingles or felt must be purchased separately.\n\nShoppers have given the granny annexe glowing reviews. \n\nOne customer praised it as \u201ceasy to erect and stylish,\u201d while another noted, \u201cThis is a very well-made summer house, but the instructions could be clearer.\u201d\n\nWith affordability and adaptability at the forefront, it\u2019s no surprise that more people are turning to granny annexes as a smart alternative to traditional housing.\n\neBay is also tapping into the growing demand for granny annexes, making this housing option more accessible than ever.\n\nCurrently available on the platform is a spacious two-bedroom granny annexe, designed to fit neatly at the back of a garden. \n\nBuilt with the unpredictable British weather in mind, it boasts damp-proofing and double glazing for year-round comfort.\n\nAccording to the eBay seller, the annexe is \u201cperfect\u201d for those looking to create a luxury cabin, additional living space, or even a mobile home. \n\nThe kit comes with all the essentials for an energy-efficient build, helping to keep running costs low.\n\nMeasuring an impressive 12 metres in length by 5 metres in width, with an internal ceiling height of approximately 2.3 to 2.4 metres, the annexe offers plenty of space and can be customised to suit individual needs. \n\nBest of all, it\u2019s priced at just \u00a3750 per square metre, making it an affordable alternative to traditional home extensions.",

face more candidate controversy amid call to review abortion laws", "text": "WA Liberal leader Libby Mettam has ruled out a review of abortion laws while distancing herself from comments made by Albany candidate Thomas Brough.\n\nOn Saturday, Ms Mettam held a press conference with Mr Brough, who is an emergency room doctor and local councillor, to announce $5 million towards the expansion of the Albany Health Campus.\n\nWhen asked if WA's abortion laws should be reviewed, Mr Brough replied \"yes\" before saying: \"Babies born alive should not be left to die.\"\n\nIn a statement sent to media after the press conference, Ms Mettam said: \"Reviewing WA's abortion laws is not part of our plan.\n\n\"The Liberal Party treats abortion, like all matters of life and death, as a conscience vote.\"\n\n\"I supported the recent reforms to WA's abortion laws in the parliament.\"\n\nA second statement from the party later in the day made the point again: \"Dr Brough \u2014 like many in the community \u2014 is entitled to his own view, but the WA Liberals will not be reviewing WA's abortion laws.\"\n\nToday's comments come a week after it was revealed Mr Brough is set to face the State Administrative Tribunal for alleged professional misconduct over claims he made linking the LGBTQIA+ community with paedophiles during a public council meeting in February last year.\n\nJust a week out from the state election, they also represent another unwelcome distraction for the Liberal Party, which has faced several candidate controversies in recent weeks.\n\nHealth minister calls for resignation\n\nWA Health Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson has called on Ms Mettam to go further.\n\n\"If these views are so out of step with the Liberal Party and it's not her intent as leader to go down the path [of reviewing abortion laws], she should ask this candidate to resign,\" she said.\n\nMs Sanderson also took aim at Mr Brough's statement that \"babies born alive should not be left to die\", which he repeated when asked to clarify his position during the press conference.\n\n\"This is complete \u2026 misinformation and it is dangerous,\" she said.\n\n\"On some rare occasions, a woman [and her partner] have to make the very difficult decision to end a pregnancy that is not viable.\n\n\"It is occasionally the choice of parents for an unviable baby to be born alive so that they may die peacefully in their arms.\n\n\"To claim that somehow women and parents are allowing an atrocity to occur is outrageous and wrong.\n\n\"That's why Libby Mettam needs to condemn these comments \u2026 on behalf of the women of Western Australia.\"\n\nWA's abortion laws were updated last year to make it easier for women to gain access to health care.\n\nMr Brough's comments could be referring to a \"children born alive\" bill introduced to federal parliament in 2022 by Queensland LNP senator Matt Canavan and SA Liberal senator Alex Antic.\n\nA Senate inquiry found the bill could affect the \"availability of pregnancy support and termination services\", there was no evidence it was needed, and ultimately made no recommendations.\n\nLive abortion births 'exceptionally rare'\n\nAlison Creagh, who has worked in abortion care for four decades, said instances of babies being born alive after failed abortions would be exceptionally rare, and she had never seen in her career.\n\n\"Exceptionally rare and certainly, even if one is done after 23 weeks, which, as I've said is very, very rare, it's exceptionally rare that it would be born alive at that point,\" Dr Creagh said.\n\nLater-term abortions after 23 weeks' gestation need the approval of two doctors in Western Australia.\n\n\"The majority of abortions are done early and, you know, it's quite uncommon that any are done even after the 12-week gestation mark,\" she said.\n\n\"It's really only in very unique and difficult circumstances that they would be done beyond that time, so I think it's quite an unhelpful way of presenting the whole field of abortion.\n\n\"I think it is really important to recognise that abortion care is a medical procedure and it's up to the person and their medical team to decide what happens with the pregnancy.\"\n\nMr Brough issued a limited apology and was ordered to undergo workplace training after he linked the LGBTQIA+ community with paedophiles.\n\nAsked about that matter today, Mr Brough said he would \"let the facts speak for themselves\".\n\n\"It's completely inappropriate that this is in the public forum. This is a confidential matter and I'm totally happy to let the process occur,\" he said.\n\nLiberal campaign derailed again\n\nMr Brough is not the first state Liberal candidate to make headlines over controversial comments.\n\nDarren Spackman, who was running for the state seat of Kimberley, resigned last week after making controversial comments during an interview, in addition to social media posts which resurfaced from 2022.\n\nA series of derogatory social media posts from Darling Range candidate Paul Mansfield also emerged from a decade ago.\n\nWA Premier Roger Cook said Ms Mettam did not have control of her own party.\n\n\"Quite frankly, the Liberal Party candidates are strange, they're bizarre, they're weird,\" Mr Cook said.\n\n\"Libby Mettam herself described [Mr Brough] as bizarre and yet she will not intervene as the leader of the Liberal Party and disendorse these candidates.\n\n\"How is it that these people are standing up saying that they're going to represent the community, when they don't even reflect the community and the values that they have?\"", "summary": "WA Liberal leader Libby Mettam has ruled out a review of abortion laws while distancing herself

the Gold Coast Suns on Friday night.\n\nA Swans spokesperson said Gulden's return to play timeline would be determined after surgery, which he will undergo on Sunday.\n\nOwens's shoulder injury added

email demanding their accomplishments", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Federal employees are starting to receive another email requiring them to explain their recent accomplishments, a renewed attempt by President Donald Trump and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk to demand answers from the government workforce.\n\nOriginally expected to go out Saturday, the new request began landing in the inboxes of some employees late Friday. The plan to send a second round of emails was initially disclosed by a person with knowledge of the situation who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.\n\nThe first email, which was distributed a week ago, asked employees \u201cwhat did you do last week?\u201d and prompted them to list five tasks that they completed. Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency has been empowered by Trump with a mission to downsize agencies and eliminate thousands of federal jobs, said anyone who didn\u2019t respond would be fired. Many agencies, meanwhile, told their workforces not to respond or issued conflicting guidance.\n\nThe second email was expected to be delivered in a different way, according to the person with knowledge of the situation, potentially making it easier to discipline employees for noncompliance.\n\nInstead of being sent by the Office of Personnel Management, which functions as a human resources agency for the federal government but doesn\u2019t have the power to hire or fire, the email was to come from individual agencies that have direct oversight of career officials.\n\nA version of the email received late Friday by some employees at two separate agencies \u2014 with the subject line, \u201cWhat did you do last week? Part II\u201d \u2014 came from \u201chr@opm.gov,\u201d the same OPM address that sent the first version. Employees at a third agency received the email from an internal department address.\n\n\u201cPlease reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets describing what you accomplished last week and cc your manager,\u201d the message read, adding that going forward, employees would be expected to submit a response each week by the following Monday at 11:59 p.m. Eastern.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how national security agencies will handle the second email. After the first one, they directed employees not to write back because much of the agencies\u2019 work is sensitive or classified. Less than half of federal workers responded, according to the White House.\n\nThe version viewed late Friday by The Associated Press reads in part: \u201cIf all of your activities are classified or sensitive, please write, \u2018All of my activities are sensitive.\u2019\u201d That may not eliminate all security concerns given that sending an email creates a digital footprint regardless of the message\u2019s content.\n\nA spokesperson for OPM did not immediately respond to a request for clarification Friday night.\n\nOn Wednesday, at Trump\u2019s first Cabinet meeting of his second term, Musk argued that his request was a \u201cpulse check\u201d to ensure that those working for the government have \u201ca pulse and two neurons.\u201d\n\nBoth Musk and Trump have claimed that some workers are either dead or fictional, and the president has publicly backed Musk\u2019s approach.\n\nAddressing people who didn\u2019t respond to the first email, Trump said \u201cthey are on the bubble,\u201d and he added that he wasn\u2019t \u201cthrilled\u201d about them not responding.\n\n\u201cNow, maybe they don\u2019t exist,\u201d he said without providing evidence. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re paying people that don\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nIn addition to recent firings of probationary employees, a memo distributed this week set the stage for large-scale layoffs and consolidation of programs.\n\nThe Education Department offered employees a $25,000 buyout and warned of looming layoffs. An email sent to all agency workers gave them until the end of Monday to decide on the offer, which was touted as coming \u201cin advance of a very significant Reduction in Force.\u201d\n\nIt was sent from the department\u2019s chief human capital officer. The agency did not immediately offer comment.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The most glamourous night in Hollywood unfolds during three-and-a-half hours of live television, nearly ensuring some sort of unexpected shocker.\n\nBut this year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\u2019 CEO Bill Kramer is really hoping the drama unfolds only in the Oscar race itself.\n\n\u201cMany of the races are wide open,\u201d Kramer told CNN in a recent interview. \u201cA lot of our possible winners are really up for grabs. It\u2019s going to be an exciting night.\u201d\n\nThis award season has embraced a flurry of sporadic winners, showcasing few consistent shoo-ins, particularly in the best picture category.\n\nThe campaign for the film \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d which leads with 13 Oscar nominations, was upended by past offensive tweets from the film\u2019s star Karla Sofia Gasc\u00f3n. A source told CNN that Gasc\u00f3n is still expected to attend the ceremony on Sunday night, though it\u2019s unclear where she\u2019ll be seated and if she\u2019ll walk the red carpet.\n\nWhen asked if the Academy considered rescinding Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s individual nomination, Kramer deflected and instead highlighted the groundbreaking nature of Gasc\u00f3n being the first openly transgender person to be nominated for an acting Oscar.\n\n\u201cAll of our nominees are invited to attend the Oscars,\u201d he said. \u201cI think what\u2019s so important this year, we have over 200 nominees,\u201d Kramer continued, adding, \u201cWe need to celebrate all of (them).\u201d\n\nSo, what will happen on Oscar Sunday? Here, the Academy CEO previews what to expect:\n\nConan O\u2019Brien will bring the laughs, but won\u2019t make celebrities cry\n\nWhy was Conan O\u2019Brien the perfect choice to host the show this year?\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a lovely person, number one. He\u2019s a humanist. He\u2019s apolitical,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cHe invites everybody in to enjoy, and he\u2019s so smart.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think, tonally, Conan strikes the perfect balance,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe never punch below the belt. That\u2019s key. This is not about making fun of people in a way that\u2019s cruel. It\u2019s not about making fun of our film industry. Conan stays above the fray.\u201d\n\nWill \u2018Wicked\u2019 open the show?\n\nThis week, major musical performers were announced for the Oscars, including Queen Latifah, Raye, Doja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, plus Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande.\n\nFor the 2025 Oscars, these superstar artists will perform as yet unannounced songs, replacing the tradition of performing the nominated best original song onstage. Instead, the songwriters nominated in the category will be recognized in a pre-produced segment that shares more of their backstories and accomplishments.\n\n\u201cWicked\u201d stars Grande and Erivo are confirmed to perform, but Kramer didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s inquiries regarding what song or songs they will sing and whether they will open the show.\n\n\u201cYou will see. You have to tune in,\u201d he allowed.\n\n\u201c\u2019Wicked\u2019 is an undeniable smash,\u201d Kramer added. \u201cCynthia and Ariana are such incredible performers. We are so thrilled that they\u2019ll be on the show this year as performers, and I think all fans of \u2018Wicked\u2019 and beyond will love what they have planned.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t expect politics to take center stage\n\nHollywood celebrities are known to make political statements at award shows, but Kramer said he hopes the night will \u201cabsolutely\u201d steer clear of politics.\n\nOf course, no one can predict what a winner will stay when they get up to the podium, but Kramer shared that guidelines are suggested to anyone taking the stage, in an effort to avoid any controversial statements.\n\n\u201cWe do talk to them about keeping things focused on the work, but this is really a moment for the artist to have for themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nGet ready for surprise A-list reunions\n\n\u201cFilmmaking is a collaborative art \u2013 more so than almost any other art form,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cThe Academy represents all components of filmmaking. We want to bring them into the show and celebrate the community of people who make movies \u2013 so reunions is one great way to do that.\u201d\n\nWhen prodded for any names, Kramer stayed mum, but ensured CNN that viewers will be surprised to see some famous familiar faces back together.\n\n\u201cWell, I obviously can\u2019t tell you any surprises today, but know that there are going to be incredible surprises on the show this year,\u201d he teased.\n\nThe Oscars will raise funds for LA wildfire rebuilding efforts\n\n\u201cWe will be celebrating Los Angeles\u2019 resilience,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be celebrating our community \u2013 not just our community of filmmakers, but the community of Los Angeles. LA has attracted filmmakers and creative visionaries for well over a century. This is a moment to really celebrate that.\u201d\n\nHe added that there will be an element to raise funds, just like the Grammy Awards did earlier this month.\n\n\u201cWe will be encouraging people to join us in supporting relief efforts throughout the night,\u201d Kramer said.\n\nEvery year, critics say that the Oscars telecast is too long. Kramer isn\u2019t blind to the criticism, but he explained that it\u2019s \u201cvery important\u201d to the Academy for \u201call disciplines to be celebrated on the show.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast year we had all of the awards on the show and we came in under time. We were under 3 hours and 30 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to do this in a way that\u2019s entertaining, and we will continue to evolve the show and to think about that.\u201d\n\nThe Academy Awards will air live on ABC and stream live on Hulu on Sunday beginning at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Those products generally save lives and money, experts say.\n\nNOAA\u2019s 301 billion weather forecasts every year reach 96% of American households.\n\nThe firings are \u201cgoing to affect safety of flight, safety of shipping, safety of everyday Americans,\u201d Admiral Tim Gallaudet told The Associated Press Friday. President Donald Trump appointed Gallaudet as acting NOAA chief during his last administration. \u201cLives are at risk for sure.\u201d\n\nFormer NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad agreed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting into prime tornado time. We\u2019re getting into planting season for the agricultural season for the bread belt,\u201d Spinrad said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to affect safety. It\u2019s going to affect the economy.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because \u201cNOAA sort of gets forgotten, until it\u2019s very important,\u201d said private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a conservative and a NOAA chief scientist under Trump.\n\n\u201cThis throws sand in the gears\u201d of an agency that is understaffed but doing \u201ca Herculean job,\u201d Maue said.\n\nElon Musk has repeatedly defended federal workforce cuts by his Department of Government Efficiency as \u201ccommon sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people voted for major government reform, and that\u2019s what the people are going to get,\u201d Musk said from the Oval Office this month. \u201cThat\u2019s what democracy is all about.\u201d\n\nWhat does NOAA do?\n\nThe agency creates daily weather forecasts from 122 local offices, issuing warnings for deadly tornadoes, hurricanes, tsunamis, wildfires and floods.\n\nDisaster and local officials use those to advise the public on how to avoid danger. Farmers use seasonal outlooks for crop advice. Pilots use aviation forecasts. Forecasts from private weather apps on phones, on television and elsewhere are based on NOAA satellites, data and forecasts.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an amazing undertaking to monitor that. You can\u2019t count on TV meteorologists to fill this gap and you can\u2019t count on private meteorology,\u201d Maue said. \u201cYou can\u2019t count on your weather app to call you up and alert you\u201d to tornadoes, severe thunderstorms and floods in your area.\n\nWhat is the potential impact of the dismissals?\n\nIn the west, dozens of NOAA meteorologists provide firefighting crews with up-to-the-minute forecasts on wind and other shifting conditions that affect fires and could mean life or death, said Elbert \u201cJoe\u201d Friday, a former director of NOAA\u2019s National Weather Service. They also are key in avalanche warnings.\n\nIn the water, ships use the agency\u2019s weather forecasts and mapping of water channels for safety, while NOAA manages fisheries worth hundreds of billions of dollars and stunning ocean sanctuaries.\n\nGallaudet, who was a Navy rear admiral, said NOAA guidance on weather and shipping channels will be so hurt by the firings that America could see more accidents like when a massive container ship ran into Baltimore\u2019s Francis Scott Key Bridge in 2024.\n\nIt was NOAA\u2019s quick work that enabled the reopening of Baltimore\u2019s economically critical port after a only a couple months, Spinrad said. In Alaska, the city of Nome wants to create a deep water port, but it needs NOAA to do a channel survey first, he said.\n\nNOAA provides the science expertise in the response to major oil spills in coastal areas, including 2010\u2019s BP Deepwater Horizon, Spinrad said.\n\nIn space, NOAA forecasts help prevent satellites \u2014 including those belonging to Musk\u2019s SpaceX \u2014 from colliding. The agency also watches for solar flares that can knock out parts of the electrical grid and hurt air traffic communications, officials said. NOAA owns or operates 18 satellites in orbit.\n\n\u201cThree years ago, SpaceX lost 40 satellites due to their ignorance of space weather implications and upper atmosphere density impacts. They immediately came to NOAA and said, \u2018hey, help us out\u2019,\u201d Spinrad said, calling it \u201can object lesson there for Elon Musk himself\u201d on the agency\u2019s value.\n\nThe National Weather Service is worth $102 billion a year to the U.S. economy, according to a 2022 study by the American Meteorological Society and economist Jeffrey Lazo. Before the current Trump administration, NOAA had a $6.7 billion budget, including nearly $1.4 billion for the National Weather Service, one of six sub-agencies.\n\nHow many NOAA workers were dismissed?\n\nNOAA officials would not reveal how many people were fired Thursday or are being let go, citing privacy. Current and past NOAA leaders and employees have given various estimates on job cuts, ranging from 580 to 1,200.\n\nSenator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, said the latest figure he has is 650 terminations.\n\nJane Lubchenco, another former NOAA chief, said the firings \u201care a national disaster and a colossal waste of money.\u201d\n\nThese are not high-paying jobs, but it\u2019s work being done by people who love it, so cutting NOAA is like going after coins in the couch, Maue said.\n\n\u201cThese are people who just live and breathe this work. These are the kind of people who come in on a day off because there\u2019s a big weather event and they want to help out,\u201d said Holy Cross University environmental sciences professor Keith Seitter, the former director of the American Meteorological Society. \u201cPeople don\u2019t go into meteorology because they want to get rich.\u201d\n\nSeitter said there will \u201cbe things that fall through the cracks where they shouldn\u2019t,\u201d because of the dismissals, warning \u201cthose things lead to situations that could be deadly\u2019\u2019\n\nGallaudet, appointed by Trump, called the cuts \u201cself-defeating,\u201d saying \u201cI could personally never work for Trump again. I did support some of the conservative policies. I still do, but he personally as a leader, he\u2019s despicable.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

I\u2019m so lucky to have that song, because it really has got me so many places.

If I sing, \u2018Come down, I don\u2019t want to come back down from this cloud,\u2019 it\u2019s usually the cloud that\u2019s in the room or the feeling I\u2019ve got at that time.

"WANSHINGTON D.C., United States, Mar 1 \u2014 Donald Trump clashed with Volodymyr Zelensky in a furious exchange at the White House on Friday, with the US president telling his Ukrainian counterpart to make a deal with Russia \u201cor we are out\u201d.\n\nThe pair interrupted each other repeatedly in front of the media during what was supposed to be a prelude to the two leaders signing a minerals deal.\n\nAfter relations first became strained over Trump\u2019s handling of Ukraine peace talks with Russia, the minerals agreement was supposed to be a stepping stone towards further security ties between the countries.\n\nBut Zelensky was told by the Americans to leave before the deal could be signed.\n\nAt one point, Trump told Zelensky he was not thankful enough for US military and political support, and that he was \u201cgambling with World War Three\u201d.\n\nZelensky had earlier argued there should be \u201cno compromises\u201d with Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2013 but Trump said Kyiv would have to make concessions to reach a peace deal with Russia.\n\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and currently controls around 20% of Ukrainian territory.\n\nFollow updates as Zelensky leaves White House early\n\nAnalysis: Trump-Zelensky row signals major crisis for Nato\n\nTimeline of Trump and Zelensky\u2019s fraying relationship\n\nCan Europe deter Russia in Ukraine without US military?\n\nWatch in full: Angry exchange between Trump and Zelensky\n\nThe meeting to discuss the US-Ukraine deal, which involved access to Ukrainian oil, gas and rare minerals, came after the new US president appeared to blame Zelensky for the war and chided him for not starting peace talks with Russia earlier.\n\nHis tone had softened in recent days, with Trump saying he had \u201ca lot of respect\u201d for the Ukrainian leader.\n\nBut Friday\u2019s conversation soured after the US Vice-President JD Vance \u2013 who was sat alongside other politicians in the room \u2013 told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy.\n\nZelensky responded by asking \u201cwhat kind of diplomacy?\u201d, referencing a previous ceasefire deal in 2019, agreed three years before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion when Moscow was supporting and arming separatist fighters in Ukraine\u2019s east.\n\nThe vice-president then accused Zelensky of being disrespectful and \u201clitigating\u201d the situation in front of the media.\n\nFrom there, the discussion escalated quickly, as Trump and Vance accused Ukraine\u2019s president of being ungrateful for three years of US support during the war with Russia, with Trump saying Zelensky was in no position to tell the US how it should feel.\n\nNot long after the meeting \u2013 and well ahead of the pre-planned schedule \u2013 Zelensky was seen leaving the White House in his official vehicle.\n\nTrump took to Truth Social, the social media platform he owns, to say \u201cZelensky disrespected the US in its cherished Oval Office\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have determined that President Zelensky is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations,\u201d the Republican president continued. \u201cI don\u2019t want advantage, I want PEACE.\u201d\n\nZelensky also posted on social media, thanking the president and the US four times.\n\nIn a later interview with Fox News, Zelensky said the public spat \u201cwas not good\u201d \u2013 but the relationship between him and Trump could be salvaged.\n\n\u201cBecause the relations are more than just two presidents,\u201d he said, adding that it was also about \u201cstrong relations between our two people.\u201d\n\nReaction to the White House meeting among US politicians appeared to fall along partisan lines, with Republicans praising Trump and Democrats criticising him.\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham \u2013 once a staunch supporter of Ukraine \u2013 told reporters: \u201cWhat I saw in the Oval Office was disrespectful and I don\u2019t know if we can ever do business with Zelensky again.\u201d\n\nHe said Zelensky \u201ceither needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change\u201d.\n\nDemocratic House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries described Zelensky\u2019s treatment as \u201cappalling\u201d, adding that it \u201cwill only serve to further embolden Vladimir Putin\u201d.\n\nIn Ukraine, there was broadly appreciation for Zelensky holding his ground over what is, for them, an existential war.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s administration was so arrogant,\u201d one man in Kyiv told the BBC. \u201cWhen you look at Zelensky\u2019s face, you understand that the discussion behind the closed doors was not so polite.\n\n\u201cThey are so rude, they don\u2019t respect the people of Ukraine. They even don\u2019t hide it.\u201d\n\nThe Oval Office spat also prompted words of support for Zelensky from key European allies, including France.\n\nA spokeswoman for UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer \u2013 who has cast himself as a mediator between the US and Europe as the Trump administration adopts a more isolationist approach to the continent \u2013 said he had spoken to both leaders.\n\nShe said Sir Keir \u201cretains unwavering support for Ukraine, and is doing all he can to find a path forward to a lasting peace\u201d.\n\nFriedrich Merz, who is expected to become Germany\u2019s next chancellor, wrote that he stood with Ukraine \u201cin good and testing times\u201d, adding: \u201cWe must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war.\u201d\n\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said that \u201ctoday, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It\u2019s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge\u201d.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, said Trump and Vance had acted with restraint. A foreign ministry spokeswoman said it was a miracle the pair hadn\u2019t hit Zelensky.", "summary": "The pair interrupted each other repeatedly in front of the media during what was supposed to be a

"Alaska's pristine waterways have long been a sanctuary for native fish \u2014 but now, an unexpected threat lurks in these waters, silently disrupting the balance that has existed for generations, reported The Travel.\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nAlaska's waterways are under attack by an unexpected invader: the northern pike.\n\nThis razor-toothed predator is secretly moving between freshwater ecosystems, decimating native fish populations. Scientists have discovered the pike can now travel through brackish water, breaking previous assumptions about their movement.\n\nResearchers first traced the fish's movement by analyzing strontium in their ear stones, a method that provides indisputable evidence of their migration. As Matthew Wooler, lead author of the study, explained: \"Strontium varies according to geology and location. If pike are moving between watersheds, you can pick it up by analyzing strontium in the otoliths.\"\n\nWhy is the northern pike concerning?\n\nThe northern pike's invasion threatens Alaska's delicate aquatic ecosystems.\n\nSince the 1950s, these fish have illegally populated 150 different water bodies, targeting juvenile salmon and trout. They were introduced by people seeking more sport fishing opportunities, but the consequences have been devastating. As The Travel wrote, the northern pike's expansion is \"causing fish native to the region to dwindle exponentially\" \u2014 which can have a massive impact on the local fishing and seafood restaurant industries.\n\nWatch now: Delta shares prototype of new suitcase made from retired jets\n\nChinook salmon, coho salmon, and rainbow trout populations have dramatically declined. These native fish are being devoured before adulthood, which may push them toward extinction. The northern pike consumes juvenile fish so quickly that entire generations are at risk.\n\n\"These populations never have an opportunity to increase as so many never make it to adulthood,\" per The Travel, which is a serious concern \"for both the freshwater ecosystems as well as the local economy.\"\n\nWhat's being done about the northern pike?\n\nAlaska's Division of Sport and Fish is fighting back. Using methods like gill nets, it's successfully removed northern pike from over 25 waterways \u2014 though gill nets have been known to harm other species.\n\nOne commenter suggested an innovative approach: \"Cash incentives for fishermen, combined with other programs,\" could help offset costs and engage the community.\n\nBut challenges remain. Chemical treatments are limited because of concerns about drinking water and completely removing the pike seems nearly impossible. With 150 locations still inhabited by these predators, time is running out for Alaska's native fish.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/experts-track-razor-toothed-predator-005500973.html", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/laVvG9c9Xs7lOtAVjfL5Vw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0Mw--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/7a1205090c5bd6420e12adc248b402e8", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 00:55:00", "author": "Leslie Sattler", "authors": ["Leslie Sattler"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.123}, {"id": 295503844, "title": "Struggle Khatam Nahi Hora: Ankit Tiwari Opens Up About Not Getting Work in the Industry, Netizens Say 'Attitude Problem'", "text": "Ankit Tiwari is known for iconic songs like Gaaliyan and Sun Raha Hai Na and has spent more than two decades in the music industry.

I heard that the BJP government in Gujarat was not alive. \u2018 Trump says he is preventing them.\n\nOur media giggles that Trump is doing this as betraying us. Under its influence, our people are also cursing Trump. Who goes there in the original illegal ways? Some of the plane landed in Amritsar also flew from Yikkan in December. December is a time when Trump won and waiting for the swearing -in. Trump\u2019s attitude towards these illegal intruders is worldwide. But if they get out of their way, look at them. Trump is giving so much publicity to the retreat of their hearts and at least in the hearts of their heart and their path.\n\nIn fact, it is no stranger to sending and shaking. It is not wrong to send it, but what to shake? That is. It has logic. Those who have to go back can try to commit suicide, so that they are tired of humiliation and attack others. Wires on the plane can peek and collapse. If the legs and their legs are tied up in their countries without giving them a chance, America is burdened with their burden! Otherwise it is a headache!\n\nHow can the student go on a visa and justify those who work illegally? Native Americans are giving opportunities for salary as per the rupee because they are ready to work for low salaries! In fact, these students are in India while Janke is the type to do illegal things. Going to America, they have the courage. There is a daring that no one cares. Trump prepared to relax their insurance. Can he take him wrong? But many are lying.\n\n\u2018Sadly, if the students do not do such a little bit of things, the parents have been borrowed and sent to the university campus, there is no part -time on the university campus, and how does it come? Appela will be fulfilled? \u2018 Arguing that. Don\u2019t know that there is no chance of earning on campus before applying to a student visa! In the absence of such income, our parents have the financial prosperity who can put me on my legs, and the bank deposits have brought a visa showing Vagira! Are those certificates lie? This means that the US plane has lied before the aircraft and starting to ride illegal ways! And how can you expect this to be the result? The seed is a crop.\n\nThis is why all this means, \u201cThere are no jobs here, there are no employment, poverty, and a man should go to America.\u201d 40-50 lakhs to borrow a student visa. In order to infiltrate the illegal routes, the loan and assets should be submitted before 40-50 lakh agents. Can you put a panshop here here with that money! What is the adventure of sacrificing survivors?\n\nHowever, there are poverty and poverty in India. Everyone is Lakshminarayana! If we step there, we are called one of them. Is that true? Is India poor? Is that poverty decreasing even after decades after independence? In May 2006, I interviewed me as \u2018Kaman India\u2019 on this issue. I am giving the interview text of the day with the feeling that there is still a revival.\n\nThe question is 01- Are there chances of reducing the average Indian poverty?\n\nAnswer \u2013 First think about changing the thinking of man than to reduce poverty. Poverty is a feeling. The idea that the opportunities to improve are not available. \u2018The God of my organ, the intelligence, the waste of myself, the feeling of being useful\u2019. If the gate is closed, it is a characteristic of sitting crying and opening the window. Let\u2019s talk about the facts put aside the emotions. There are many skilled and unlimited jobs in the society around us.\n\nThere is a shortage of electrician, plumber, security, camera assistant and script writer in your studio. There are many tasks pending. We are constantly looking for a computer mechanic, for a car mechanic, for a car driver, and tire puncturer. Those who come forward will not work. There is no skill. There is no agility. There is a lot of vacuum. There are many gaps. Why not fill them? Can we sit down saying that this does not come? Is the farmer and the city to come to the city if agriculture is not a worker? Is the worker being a shopkeeper? I have not shifted from electronics to genetic yinjinering from electronics?\n\nAsk in the villages due to government welfare programs, the fields are not coming to the fields, ask in cities, and can not find a skilled label into the factory. On the other hand, unemployment is growing. What is Enamali? What\u2019s the disaster? The real thing is, everyone is studying. After studying, you want to do anything other than white collar jobs. But white collar jobs are decreasing. When the computer arrived, the clerks were gone. Unemployment and poverty. But at the same time there are many vacancies in professional employment.\n\nGo to the tailor shop and ask for late. Tailors are not coming and the local people are coming from UP somewhere. Ask in a jewelery shop \u2013 gold workers are not able to find. Ask in the beauty parent \u2013 the shortage of workers and the girls from the northeastern states. We do not have an actor who works for them. The shortage of nurses and come from Kerala. Before most shops, boards are found in supermarkets\u2019 Sales Men Wanted! Sales Girls Wanted \u2018. And in these circumstances, there is no employment opportunities here and there is poverty? This is due to the lack of adaptability because of the mentality that is not a job except a white collar job.\n\nQuestion 02 \u2013 Why do we not diminish what poverty is in the country?\n\nAnswer \u2013 The definition of poverty is changed! We have been accustomed to asking subsidies from the government to claim the poor. Everybody is proud to say that I am a poor man and a backward man. Stamping that the poor is a slut. Stop giving them concessions and instead of them, \u2018Come on, come, come and make money.\u2019 That is ok. Then no one says I am poor.\n\nAll the rehabilitation centers built for the fists are empty. The roads are crowded with fist. Why? There they work by them. So they don\u2019t go. It is better to be comfortable with it. If the employees are shop at 6 pm, they will continue to be \u2018duty\u2019 at 10 and 11 pm. Our society is also made of fisting fist on the streets. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do anything, if you get old, if you are in a certain caste, we will send money for a month, you will give you a free ration, you will get married,\u201d he said. Just say I am the poor. \u2018 Governments say that I am the poor and I am the poor.\n\nQuestion 03 \u2013 What are your suggestions to change their mindset?\n\nAnswer \u2013 There should be compulsory education. Teach vocational education and adopt the Dignity of Labor. White collar Jobs should be reduced. BIPL (Bilo Powery Line) should help them to provide free freely for a period of three months and six months. Poverty should be firmly planted in the brain of the people. Shatatha tries to get out of it. Otherwise this is what! He is mentally poor.\n\nQuestion 04 \u2013Should their mindset change in the country? What is the role of industrial progress in economic progress? How does the average Indian affect?\n\nAnswer \u2013 If industries increase, the production will increase. Increases the availability of goods. Citizens are hoping to own them and increase the standard of living. As hopes and needs are increased, they have the desire to earn more in them. It has to work hard to earn. If everyone works hard automatically, everyone will be financially good. If purchases are increased, you will look for quality. Nasi kinds are dropped from the market. Therefore, producers make quality.\n\nExport opportunities will increase if quality standards are increased. Exports can improve the economic status of the country. Forex reserves increase enough to import good, high -capacity machines and technology. Those machines further enhance the product. If an industry is firmly rooted in one place, it will create a number of affiliates.\n\nFor example the automobile sector! One of the car factory has come up with hundreds of spare parts that are used in it \u2013 many industries are born around it. This is a reason for Tamil Nadu to grow well. There is an automobile industry.\n\nThe IT industry in our state has no convenience. Ansillary Industries is very low. Thus industries should come. Then we will get better. But all our enthusiasm is on the service sector. What if the call centers get? Nothing to be affiliated with them!\n\nQuestion 05 \u2013 What are the major problems faced by our country industries?\n\nAnswer \u2013 The first is corruption. I am unaware of what will happen to the area if you are allowed to put a particular industry. What\u2019s wrong with me? The politician sees that. He does not look back on the other side if he has no economic or politically profit. The second is Red Tapism. What\u2019s the damage to me if the industry is not allowed? Bureaucrat thinks that. They have no targets. If you do not get this month in your area, your job is not. The average employee thinks that my pension will be embarrassed if you sign the file and then have any implications. Therefore he sees to avoid doing anything as much as possible. He prepares any rules and applies them to it, but creates obstacles. The third is the finance. Bankers will look at the industry\u2019s defendant suspicion. They do not have the ability to understand and assess if you go with the new type of project. Because they do not update their knowledge.\n\nQuestion 06 \u2013 What are your advice to mend the situation?\n\nAnswer \u2013 The single window system should really be implemented. Permits in the name of committees should be stopped. The excitement should not be killed by unrelated checklists. Reforms should be introduced in protocol methods to suit the changing times. Officers have to teach what is happening in the contemporary world with revision courses. They have to lock them out of their minds. It should be taught to see the common man\u2019s perspective.\n\nQuestion 06 \u2013 What\u2019s your advice to enthusiasts?\n\nAnswer \u2013 Field facts should be taken as challenge. Should not be disappointed that the conditions are not favorable. It should be realized that the wind blows on the kite. There should be both patience and endurance. Do not compromise on quality. Brand Image \u2013 We need to protect our nation. It is a victory for the community welfare. Profits may not be able to get back along with your extent and will be in the field for ten years. Recognize.\n\nThis is the interview of that day. Later, welfare programs have increased. More and more lazy are being made. \u2018If you work hard here, only Rs. Dollars will fall if it is difficult to smuggle in the US. \u2018 The idea is taken to risk. As a result we do not find work here. There is no staff to find those who work there illegally!\n\n\u2013 K.I. Varaprasad Reddy (Santa Biotechnics)", "summary": "Trump is chasing illegal intruders from the US.

And though the star, 40, decided to take the leap without a new job lined up yet, Blackpool-born Nikki admits that she wouldn't be averse to returning to the famous cobbles of Corrie, if the opportunity arose.\n\n Nikki made her debut appearance on the Channel 4 soap as Maxine in November 2012, aged 28, after becoming a household name playing hairstylist Candice Stowe on Coronation Street from 1999 to 2005. Asked if she would jump the soap shift and go back to the soap that made her a star, she replies, \u201cNever say never is my approach.\u201d \n\nThe actress adds: \u201cI love Candice and I love Coronation Street, so I\u2019d never close myself to anything if they did want me back in the future, that\u2019s the exciting thing about doing what I do. You just never know what might happen next. \n\n\u201cWho knew way back when as a little girl going to drama classes at The Carol Godby Theatre Workshop I\u2019d spend the next 30 years working because of them? I\u2019m under no illusion that it\u2019s much tougher than it used to be out there, but I\u2019m positive and have faith that I\u2019ll achieve all I dream of in life, especially having Anthony, my family, and my friends by my side.\u201d\n\nThe decision to walk away from Hollyoaks, she continues, was an \u201cincredibly difficult\u201d one, but she felt it was the right time. And now, after much of her working life on soaps, Nikki admits she is a mix of excited and nervous to get out there and audition again. \u201cNow you have show reels and self tapes, but I never had to do that as you were just in a room with a casting director,\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the digital CV, whereas before you had the Spotlight catalogue which was like a Yellow Pages for actors!\n\n \u201cI\u2019m excited about learning about this new world but I also have fear because I\u2019m under no illusions of how the industry works, and there\u2019s always the potential that you\u2019ll never work again. But I want to be as positive as possible and see myself in these really incredible productions out there, and I\u2019ll do everything in my power to be able to do that.\u201d \n\nNikki, who turned 40. last year, also reveals in the exclusive chat and shoot that one of her favourite \u201cthings\u201d is her boyfriend of three-and-a-half years, Hollyoaks alumni Anthony Quinlan, who played Gilly Roach from 2005 to 2011. The couple, who live together in the North West, went public with their romance in 2022 but keep their relationship largely out of the public eye.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to talk too much about my personal life, but I will say I\u2019m the happiest I\u2019ve ever been, Anthony is incredible\u201d she grins, when we ask about whether they\u2019ve talked about marriage or babies. \u201cI\u2019m in a wonderful, happy relationship, so let\u2019s see what the future holds!

Place the pan over a high heat and bring the water to the boil. Reduce the heat and leave the potatoes on a gentle boil for 10-15 minutes, until they fall off the tip of a knife. Drain in a colander.\nLeave the potatoes in the colander, over the pan on the turned-off hob, to steam-dry with a tea towel over the top for 10-15 minutes.\nMeanwhile, heat the oven to 240\u00b0C/220\u00b0C fan/475\u00b0F/Gas 9, and get the oil into a baking tray. Pop the tray in the oven to get the oil hot.\nOnce the spuds have steam-dried, carefully add them to the hot oil in the baking tray. Pop the potatoes in the oven for 20 minutes, then remove the tray from the oven. Turn the heat down to 200\u00b0C/180\u00b0C fan/400\u00b0F/Gas 6. Give the potatoes a turn and return them to the oven for 30 minutes, until golden and crunchy. You may need less or more time, so keep an eye out.\nDuring the last 15 minutes of the potato roasting time, make your reduction. Get a large, high-sided frying pan (like a saut\u00e9 pan) and add the wine, shallot and garlic. Place this over a high heat and bring the liquid to a rapid boil, leaving it to boil until reduced by about half. Then, reduce the heat and, little by little, whisk in the butter and chopped herbs, until you have a velvety sauce.\nToss the potatoes in the saucy reduction and season with salt and black pepper.

Last week, the Broccoli family yielded creative control over the franchise to Amazon MGM Studios.\n'Hallmark of Britishness'\n\nFor Brits, 007 \"is not just A.N. Other action hero\", said Janice Turner in The Times: \"he's our soft power, our collective national id\" \u2013 an alluring mix of \"tradition and modernity\" and \"understated cool\", \"salted\" with a dash of humour. Now, it's only a matter of time before Jeff Bezos and his algorithm-led streaming platform turn Bond into a bland, \"Americanised\" figure.\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

But this should at least end the Bond drought. New films used to come along every three years or so, but it has been four since Daniel Craig's swansong, \"No Time to Die\", and no new installment is in sight. This is largely due to infighting between Amazon (which bought MGM and the rights to Bond in 2017) and Barbara Broccoli, whose father launched the films in 1962. After one fractious meeting, she reportedly labelled Amazon executives \"f**king idiots\" for describing Bond films as \"content\". Now that the family has ceded their control \u2013 reportedly for a cool \u00a31 billion \u2013 someone might \"finally be motivated\" to make a film.\n\nThere is a reason Bezos paid this \"supervillain's bounty\", said Alexander Larman in The Spectator: the deal has given Amazon what all studios covet \u2013 control over the series' intellectual property. Just as Disney has \"so inexpertly done with 'Star Wars'\", Bezos will now milk the franchise for all it's worth: get ready for spinoffs galore, from Teen Bond to Blofeld's \"origin story\".\nIt's a shame.

It returned to our screens last week, following the final of The Masked Singer. A new face is on the judging panel for some of the audition days due to the temporary absence of Bruno Tonioli. Find out more about who the guest judge is. Listen now on Screen Babble: Don't miss our ultimate Oscars guide - and The Traitors It is the second week of auditions on BGT and it will once again be starting at 7pm today (March 1), ITV has confirmed. Viewers can expect the show to start at around this time every week going forward. The episode will run until 8.15pm this week, including ad-breaks. It will then be followed by the Brit Awards on ITV1. Britain\u2019s Got Talent will run for approximately 10 minutes less this week than it did 7 days ago. This is due to the show running slightly longer to mark its return - the episode on March 8 will also be approximately 75 minutes including ad-breaks. The show will be live on ITV1/ 1HD from 7pm today - and if you can\u2019t watch it live it will be available an hour later on ITV1+1. It will also be available on demand via ITVX.

A spokesperson for Liverpool John Lennon Airport said: \u201cThe charges to this car park have remained unchanged for over two years and remain in line with those at many UK airports. \u201cThe airport is currently investing heavily in new and improved passenger facilities and is facing rising operational costs following the plans to increase national insurance and the minimum wage which are being applied to all businesses and we're doing all we can to minimise the impact of these increased costs for passengers.\u201d Bristol Airport said: \u201cIncreased costs associated with the rise in the National Insurance rate for employers has informed the Airport\u2019s decision to increase the charges for Drop & Go. The increased price also helps discourage longer stays in an area with limited spaces, while also encouraging the use of more sustainable forms of transport to the Airport, including public transport.\u201d Leeds Bradford Airport currently charges \u00a37 for a 10-minute stay. Electric cars can use the Pick Up and Drop Off car park for up to 1 hour free of charge, but you must let staff know you\u2019re driving a fully electric vehicle via the intercom. At Glasgow Airport, the Pick Up and Drop Off is charged at \u00a35.50 for up to a 15 minutes stay. At the start of the year, Heathrow's Terminal Drop-Off Charge increased from \u00a35 to \u00a36 per visit. Luton\u2019s Drop-off and Pick-up Zone costs \u00a35 for five minutes. Manchester Airport charges \u00a35.00 for a five-minute stay, and \u00a36.20 for a 10-minute stay. Edinburgh Airport charges \u00a36.00 for a drop-off stay of up to 10 minutes. The drop-off area at Birmingham Airport is \u00a36.00 for 15 minutes. At East Midlands Airport, it costs \u00a35.00 for a drop-off stay of up to 15 minutes. Newcastle Airport has a \u00a35.00 drop-off fee for stays of up to 10 minutes. At Belfast City Airport and Belfast International Airport, there\u2019s a drop-off charge of \u00a33.00 for up to 10 minutes. Southampton Airport charges \u00a36 for a 20-minute drop-off stay.

There's an AMOLED screen on the back which gives you notifications and access to some of the basic functions. \n\nIt comes with Android 14 pre-loaded, running off an 8-core chip with 32gb of DDR ram, and 256gb of storage. \n\nThe camera setup is also impressive. There's a 100mp main camera, a 20mp night-vision mode, it shoots 4K video, and uses AI technology to enhance pictures. \n\nIt supports 5G and WiFi 6, 33w fast charging, and we haven't even got to the best bits yet.\n\nDoogee's USP is phones that can stand up to abuse. And the S200 is built for rough treatment. \n\nIts casing is made from aerospace-grade aluminium which meets military spec MIL-STD-810H certification and there are IP69 and IP69K protection levels from water, humidity, dust and sand.\n\nAnd, let me remind you, this phone can be bought for just \u00a3259.99. Sim free. \n\nTo put that into perspective, the Google Pixel Pro XL is \u00a31,099 at the moment, and the iPhone 16 Pro is \u00a3999. \n\nReality check time, though. It will not outperform a flagship smartphone. The hardware may be impressive on paper, but in use it just isn't as polished. \n\nThe camera, for example is pretty good on the Doogee S200, but a Pixel, iPhone, or Samsung would run rings around it, especially on video performance. \n\nWhile the display is nice and fluid and crisp, a Samsung S25 would put it to shame. \n\nAnd its processor is capable of handling some very strenuous tasks, but you can overwork it with some resource-hungry apps and games that a true flagship would handle. \n\nBut we need to put things into perspective. This isn't a stylish trinket for people who want the latest and best smartphone tech on the market. I'm blown away by how well it performs, but it's a tool, built for people who need a tool. \n\nIt's designed for the sorts of people who'll find the onboard \"ToolBag\" menu useful. Does your iPhone have a \"plumb bob\", for example? No.\n\nLove magazines but hate the cost? With Readly, you can access dozens of top tech titles for one low price \u2013 and right now, you can get two months free. Click here for more information.\n\nDoes your Pixel have a protractor or a \"gradienter\"? I don't know what that is, but I know mine doesn't. \n\nThe Doogee S200's one-click shortcuts even have an option to start the underwater camera - that's how practical and robust this thing its. \n\nIt is, however, unashamedly bulky. It feels like a conventional smartphone in an extremely hefty case. But it's heavier. If you're used to an iPhone XS, it'll shock you. \n\nI found the built-in speakers a bit tinny, and I wish it had wireless charging but its futuristic, almost sci-fi design is so appropriate for its USP, and it'll be the perfect companion for people who work on dirty building sites for a living. \n\nIf you like a dainty little phone that you can slip in a pocket or a bag, look away now. This isn't for you.\n\nBut if you like the great outdoors, if you work in an environment that kills phones quickly, or even if you\u2019re just especially clumsy, this is perfect. \n\nAnd I'm sorry to keep going on about this, but it really is an absolute bargain.", "summary": "The Doogee S200 is tough enough to meet military test standards - consumer technology writer Gareth Butterfield gives his verdict", "url": "https://www.thescarboroughnews.co.uk/recommended/this-rugged-dual-screen-smartphone-is-an-amazing-price-right-now-weve-tested-it-5010774", "image": "https://www.thescarboroughnews.co.uk/jpim-static/image/2025/02/27/15/49/DSC00642.jpeg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75&crop=3:2,smart&trim=", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 08:00:31", "author": "Gareth Butterfield", "authors": ["Gareth Butterfield"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.237}, {"id": 295503734, "title": "Mozilla is already revising its new Firefox terms to clarify how it handles user data", "text": "Mozilla is revising its new Terms of Use for Firefox introduced on Wednesday following criticisms over language that seemed to give the company broad ownership over user data.

Since its inception on February 4, 2008, Jacknjellify has been a pioneering force in the realm of online entertainment, engaging audiences with its iconic series, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBattle for Dream Island\u00e2\u0080\u009d (BFDI), \u00e2\u0080\u009cBattle for BFDI\u00e2\u0080\u009d (BFB), \u00e2\u0080\u009cBFDI: The Power of Two\u00e2\u0080\u009d (TPOT), and a plethora of other imaginative animations. Seeking to expand its library of over 600 videos, Jacknjellify hired animator Sutton Hull in 2020. He quickly established himself as a standout creative contributor and earned the role of Lead Animator, helping to guide the artistic style of Jacknjellify. In just four years, his high-quality animation on the Jacknjellify series \u00e2\u0080\u009cBattle for Dream Island\u00e2\u0080\u009d has accumulated over 90 million views for the channel on YouTube, on top of an already staggering 1.7 billion global views across the channel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lifetime. On one occasion, Sutton Hull animated six scenes for one episode within 2 weeks, constituting a fifth of its 30-minute runtime without compromising quality, a feat most animators know is nearly impossible. The episode in question, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBFDI:TPOT 7: The Seven Wonders of Goiky\u00e2\u0080\u009d, received 5 million views due to Hull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crucial animation work. It is no coincidence that the episodes went viral within a year of Hull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s onboarding to the animation team\u00e2\u0080\u0094his artistry elevates the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visual style to new heights. The episode \u00e2\u0080\u009cBFDI:TPOT 7\u00e2\u0080\u009d received 8.6/10 on iMDB, indicating a positive audience reception to Hull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visual influence. Furthermore, BFDI earned the Cartoon Crave Award for \u00e2\u0080\u009cOutstanding Web Series\u00e2\u0080\u009d in 2021. Hull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role as Lead Animator isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t confined to Jacknjellify\u00e2\u0080\u0099s show TPOT; he will lead many new animation projects that have yet to be announced. Outside of his animation skills, Hull's primary contribution is helping to continuously define the style for assets, backgrounds, and props for TPOT. Hull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deep understanding of BFDI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s characters and storyline, stemming from over twelve years of following the show, grants him a unique ability to animate the characters accurately without contradicting their established history. His inevitable promotion to Lead Animator has him sitting in all aspects of production, from writing to designing and animating. It is a testament to how important and irreplaceable Hull has become to the Jacknjellify team. Maintaining a reputation as one of the fastest and most reliable animators for Jacknjellify, Hull claims the most challenging animation scenes during production. In the episode \u00e2\u0080\u009cBFDI:TPOT 6: The Great Goikian Bake-Off\u00e2\u0080\u009d, Hull animated three montage sequences set to musical narration in an innovative storybook-inspired visual style, allowing the music and lyrics to take the focus. The episode was released in select theaters in Los Angeles and New York City during the summer of 2023, selling over 3,300 Tickets. Hull will play a pivotal role in the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annual theatrical screenings. His work will be showcased in theaters within the US, potentially expanding to theaters in Canada, Australia, and Europe over the next few years. In 2024, Jacknjellify hosted more live theatrical screenings of \u00e2\u0080\u009cBFDI:TPOT 12: What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Up Bell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s String?\u00e2\u0080\u009d an episode for which Hull acted as Lead Animator. Thousands of fans watched Hull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work on the silver screen in several cities around the US, including New York City, Chicago, Houston, Fort Lauderdale, and Seattle. Thanks to Hull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reliable ability to entertain crowds with his animation and storytelling, the screenings sold close to 15,000 tickets, representing a significant milestone for the company. Hull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s animation is slated for translation into several other languages, including Hindi, Japanese, and Italian. Hull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work has already been successfully translated into Spanish on a sister channel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cJacknjellify en Espa\u00c3\u00b1ol,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which has gained 882,000 subscribers in two years. Jacknjellify's future looks bright with Hull at the helm of the animation team. BFDI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current season, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Power of Two\u00e2\u0080\u009d, is slated to continue for at least another 15 episodes. Hull will be a Lead Animator to ensure the animation quality exceeds expectations until the season concludes. Hull will thrive in the animation department with plans to take on leading roles for other unreleased projects. Hull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s invaluable credibility and work ethic define the expectations for the Jacknjellify channel, cementing his position as an irreplaceable member of the team for years to come.Peter Ruette JACKNJELLIFY LLC +1 6827773260 email us here Legal Disclaimer: EIN Presswire provides this news content \"as is\" without warranty of any kind.

The Globe became that place for me, where I felt seen, valued, and emboldened and asked to help move the institution towards a progressive future of inclusion and diversity. \n\n\u201cEvery time I see an advertisement for The Shakespeare\u2019s Globe Theatre, my heart sinks. \n\n\u201cI never wanted to be in this position and have suffered a cruel battle getting to this horrid point.

She accuses theatre bosses of being slow to response to her disclosure, and says she accompanied her accusation with voicemails of the actor \u201cthreatening to do it again\u201d.\n\nMs Stevens says the theatre then said it would \u201cpause this working relationship\u201d. \n\nAs part of her claim, she points to a public statement from the theatre\u2019s chief executive Neil Constable which says it took her allegation \u201cincredibly seriously\u201d and conceded: \u201cWe recognise that there was a fault in our safeguarding reporting procedure, which took place immediately following Athena reporting her experiences to us. \n\n\u201cWe deeply regret this and have communicated this to Athena most sincerely.\u201c \n\nThe theatre said the fault had been dealt with and an internal investigation was launched. \n\nThe three-week hearing at South London employment tribunal is due to start on Monday.", "summary": "Athena Stevens says she was traumatised by Shakespeare\u2019s Globe bosses\u2019 response to her disclosure of \u2018sexual abuse\u2019", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/actor-shakespeares-globe-theatre-abuse-athena-stevens-b1214022.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/02/28/17/55/Athena-Stevens-2.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 07:01:12", "author": "Tristan Kirk", "authors": ["Tristan Kirk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.048}, {"id": 295589290, "title": "I hate that Monster Hunter Wilds' coolest Palico armour is the product of its grossest monster", "text": "The Rompopolo. Sounds like a bouncy, round little chicken creature or something, doesn't it? It's a wonderful word to roll off the tongue - assonance abounds in every syllable, and the cute, repeated plosive of 'poh poh' at the end almost has a children's cartoon character-flavour to it, like Pok\u00e9mon's seal starter Popplio, for example, or Studio Ghibli's Totoro.\n\nWhat this word doesn't conjure is an enormous inflatable mosquito monster whose pin-prick red eyes and saggy sacks of blue and purple skin all over its body are the stuff of nightmares. The Rompopolo is horrible, and I hate everything about it - the way its long, pointed insect beak chitters and jabs at you with its lashing, poison-laced tongue, the short, thrusty spikes of its spindly, needle-like arms, and most of all, how it plants its stinger-tipped tail into the muck of Azuz's oil basins, sucks up the gunge in large, throbbing gulps, and gradually fills its slack, shrivelled skin until it's full to bursting.\n\nIt's up there with the Khezu - the blind, creepy white worm with only a gaping red, lipsticked maw of a mouth - as one of Monster Hunter's grimmest and grossest creations for me, and under any other circumstance I would give this popped blister of a creature the widest possible berth. But Wilds has made the terrible decision to hide one of the best armour sets for your Palico cat pal inside the bowels of the Rompopolo, which means I've had to kill this grotesque chump of a mosquito-raptor several times in a row now so I can enjoy its spoils.\n\nBecause honestly, how could you say no to dressing up your Palico as a little cat-shaped brain in a jar with a robotic suit? Impossible!\n\nIn fairness, it's not just the Palico Rompopolo armour that caught my attention. The Hunter armour you can craft from its hides, claws and poison sacs is pretty neat too, especially the male version that gets you the long, plague-doctor gas mask and the pulsing, puffed-up neck pillow that adorns your torso. Infinitely better than the female shower cap incarnation, that's for sure. The male belt coil is fantastic, too - a long, half skirt with scissors, syringes and other doctor tools all latched to the outside like you're about to splice open your next monster carcass and conduct some dubious experiment on it, pumping it full of goodness knows what with the tubes on the back of your gloves that thread all the way through to the claw-like tips of your fingers.\n\nThe problem is that a lot of these pieces, for Hunters and Palicos alike, require Rompopolo beaks - a rare forging material that's hard to come by on any given hunt. You can craft the Rompopolo Palico Supersoaker-style bazooka gun with just a single Rompopolo claw, for example, while its Mr. Freeze-esque robo-body - replete with bioluminescent tubes connecting its neck and legs - only needs one of its hides. Both are common materials you can scrounge off its corpse once you've slain it, or when you break bits off it by attacking the red, glowing wounds you can inflict on it during battle.\n\nBut the cat brain helmet needs a Rompopolo beak, and I had to kill three or four of these overgrown mosquito-saurs before I managed to salvage one through the RNG of the game's carcass carving. And once I'd started down this path, it only felt right to complete the Hunter set, too, which required even more beaks to finish off its plague doctor helm (naturally), as well as its greaves and vambraces. By the time I was done, I had half a dozen Rompopolo kills under my belt, and I vowed never to go near it ever again.\n\nI don't normally put such effort into crafting specific armour sets in Monster Hunter. My Hunter and Palico usually look like they've just rummaged through the TK Maxx of Monster Hunter bargain bins and grabbed whatever hodgepodge of clothes they can lay their paws on. Some bone plates there, some big tufty fur pieces here, maybe a natty shoulder pad or two... You know what I mean. Rarely do I go all out and complete a set, either for me or my cat companion. But there was something about that ridiculous cat brain in a jar that I couldn't resist. Its pink, spongy grey matter still has tiny, cute cat ears, for crying out loud! And I cannot get over how adorably pudgy the suit is. It looks strangely soft and cuddly, even though the glass tubes and jar head would no doubt feel hard, cold and clammy against the skin.\n\nMostly, though, I just love how Capcom's designers have managed to extrapolate such apt and exquisite clothing options from such a gross and ghastly monster. It's not a feeling exclusive to Monster Hunter Wilds, I should note - everyone knows the real reason they play this game isn't to bring ever-larger dragons under your heel, but to cut them up and fashion the most preposterous costumes possible out of their skin and bones. Wilds' Ajarakan, for example - a big rocky gorilla lad who can ignite his craggy exterior with volcanic force - all but transforms you into the titular demigod from Asura's Wrath, while the enormous spider-crab Nersyclla, on the other hand, lets you morph into a veritable Gundam-esque mech suit.\n\nThey ooze cool and enviable gasps of aspiration whenever you glimpse them in the armour preview menus, though I will admit that some armour sets are almost too distracting for their own good. It's why I usually only ever craft the bits I like the best, as running around as a full-blown mech human in a game about hunting fantasy dinosaurs for a living just doesn't sit quite right with me somehow.\n\nThe Rompopolo armour, though, goes above and beyond expectations. While the cat brain in a jar verges on the cusp of being immersion-breaking for me, the Hunter armour sits at just the right juncture of appeal and believability. The plague doctor get-up, with its beaky gas mask, toxic tubes and sharp instruments, couldn't be a more perfect distillation of what a mutant mosquito would look like if you peeled off its skin and ransacked its organs to walk down the catwalk with, and it's not so entirely out there as a concept that it doesn't still fit in with the game's wider medieval fantasy setting. And if you're going to don the evil doctor scientist look for your Hunter, you might as well go the whole hog and follow the Palico version through to its logical conclusion.\n\nEverything is just right, in other words, and I can already feel myself starting to resist the urge to pollute it with other, better bits of monster armour the further I get in its main story campaign. I can stave off having to change out of it for my Hunter for a while, thanks to the upgrade possibilities brought on by my increasing number of Armour Cores, but the Palico version is afforded no such staying power. Still, I'm a big believer in wearing what you like rather than necessarily what's best in Monster Hunter games, so there's a strong chance it will continue to persist for a little while yet the more I play.\n\nThe main thing, though, is that I never have to fight another Rompopolo by choice ever again, which is a relief. There has never been a more excruciating disconnect between the sound of a monster's name and the reality of seeing it in the flesh, and I'm so very glad I can put this one behind me now. Its bones have been picked clean, and the last of its inflatable skin sacs have been popped. Who's the monster now, eh?", "summary": "The Rompopolo.

It demands a date for a referendum on keeping operations in public ownership.\n\nUnite argues that Uisce \u00c9ireann\u2019s operations have faced a \u2018crisis\u2019 in Cork since management outsourced the ownership of a water treatment plant in the area.

Now, a study has stated that the formation of the glass in the victim's brain could be because of fossilised brain tissue.Guido Giordano, a volcanologist at Roma Tre University in Rome and lead author of the study, stated that the person's body tissue must have been heated to above 950 degrees Fahrenheit before cooling rapidly and transforming into glass. The process is called vitrification. \"Obsidian glass, that is, volcanic glass, forms when lava is very quickly cooled, for example, where it enters into water,\" Mr Giordano added.According to scientists, the pyroclastic flows, which consist of fast-moving volcanic material and hazardous gas from Mount Vesuvius, were not hot enough to convert the victim's brain into glass.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Scientists state that these flows reached a maximum temperature of 465 degrees Celsius and cooled down too slowly for vitrification to happen.Rather, researchers think the person's brain may have vitrified because of a short but highly hot ash cloud at the time. Some scientists, however, remain doubtful since soft tissue must be exposed to extremely particular circumstances before it can become glass.The young man's spine and skull likely prevented the heat from destroying his brain entirely, allowing some of it to change into a unique substance that looked like glass.Archaeologists unearthed the charred remains of the victim in the 1960s, who was said to be around 20 years old during the volcanic eruption. They found the victim's skull in the coastal town of Herculaneum.However, in 2018, Italian anthropologist Pier Paolo noticed something shiny inside a man's skull and started investigating it. That's when they found out the victim's brain had turned black and had glass-like pieces, which is extremely rare.Previous research has shown that neurons and proteins in the individual's brain were preserved, said Giordano. The discovery has the potential to change quite a few theories about the impact and sequence of events during the Mount Vesuvius eruption.", "summary": "In 2020, the researchers found a black, glassy substance inside the victim&#039;s skull and spinal cord.\u00a0", "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/scientists-reveal-how-2-000-year-old-mount-vesuvius-victim-039-s-brain-turned-into-glass-7821989", "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-07/esmrv9n8_mount-vesuvius-crater-afp-650_625x300_13_July_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 07:30:08", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.345}, {"id": 295588886, "title": "Football: Kashima tie J1 home record, Tokyo's Maki Kitahara debuts at 15", "text": "Kashima Antlers tied the J-League first-division record by going 25 home games unbeaten with a 2-0 win over FC Tokyo on Saturday, while winless two-time reigning champions Vissel Kobe were stunned 1-0 by 10-man Avispa Fukuoka.\n\nFC Tokyo midfielder Maki Kitahara, meantime, set a J1 record with his youngest appearance at 15 years, 7 months, 22 days, rewriting the previous record set in 2004 by former Japan and Catania forward Takayuki Morimoto by more than two months.\n\nAfter beginning the season with an away defeat, Antlers have since won three straight, all at their Kashima Stadium.

After meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the two sides had resolved to \u201celiminate impediments\u201d to improving bilateral relations, a phrasing that sent chills down the spines of Russian exiles \u2014 myself included \u2014 who have sought what at the time seemed like safe harbor in the United States.\n\nOf course, Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, has his sights set on much more than a bunch of political exiles. And his negotiations with President Trump about Ukraine are not just about Ukraine. Putin wants nothing less than to reorganize the world, the way Joseph Stalin did with the accords he reached with Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill in the Crimean city of Yalta in February 1945. Putin has wanted to carve the globe up for a long time. Now, at last, Trump is handing him the knife.\n\nHow do I know Putin wants this? Because he has said so.

The agency, identified as Samen-Zorgzaam B.V., supplied personnel to multiple healthcare institutions across the Netherlands. \n\nAccording to IGJ reports, \u201cUnqualified personnel have been found working directly with vulnerable patients, leading to an increasing number of serious incidents and safety risks.\u201d Some workers reportedly had connections to organizations with extremist motivations.\n\nHealth inspectors have documented numerous incidents linked to unqualified personnel in Dutch healthcare facilities. Reports detail cases of severe burns from improper bathing procedures, incorrect catheter insertions causing injury, and even instances where patients were recruited for criminal activities.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice and Security confirmed that legal action is now being pursued against a fraction of the identified cases, while others remain outside the scope of prosecution due to legal technicalities.\n\nSamen-Zorgzaam B.V., founded in 2018 and based in Utrecht, facilitated staffing in mental health care, elderly care, and disability support. Investigative journalists from RTL Nieuws traced its involvement to some of the largest healthcare providers in the country, including Zozijn, Alliade, De Trans-Espria, and Arkin. Documents obtained by RTL confirm that unqualified workers were active in facilities operated by these organizations at the time of the investigation.\n\nAndr\u00e9 den Exter, associate professor of health law at Erasmus University, condemned the oversight. \u201cThe care provider is responsible. They must ensure quality healthcare. That is a legal obligation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is straightforward: human resources must verify an employee\u2019s qualifications before hiring.\u201d\n\nThe IGJ and law enforcement agencies have expressed growing concerns about fraudulent employment agencies operating within the Dutch healthcare sector. Recent reports suggest that some agencies have direct links to organized crime. Authorities have identified cases where violent criminals, including drug traffickers and ATM bombers, managed to secure jobs in healthcare settings using falsified credentials.\n\nDespite the clear dangers posed by unqualified personnel, oversight reportedly remains inadequate. The number of healthcare staffing agencies has surged in recent years, with hundreds operating nationwide and managing an estimated 3 billion euros in healthcare funding annually. However, no dedicated authority exists to regulate these agencies, leaving room for abuse.\n\nInvestigators found that Samen-Zorgzaam was flagged after multiple complaints were lodged with IGJ. In collaboration with the Labor Inspectorate, police, the Municipality of Utrecht, and the Public Prosecution Service, authorities launched an in-depth probe that led to the discovery of dozens of fraudulent placements.\n\nOf the more than 60 identified unqualified workers, only 15 are facing criminal charges for using falsified diplomas. The remaining individuals\u2014who lacked any formal healthcare certification but were not found to have forged documents\u2014are unlikely to face prosecution.\n\nAccording to Den Exter, this is a major loophole in the legal framework. \u201cLying about qualifications is unethical, but if there is no evidence of illegal medical practices, prosecution becomes difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only solution is stricter enforcement by care institutions and the IGJ.\u201d\n\nCompany registration records reviewed by RTL Nieuws show that the three owners of Samen-Zorgzaam recently launched a new employment agency under the name Talenzo. When questioned, one of the owners denied knowledge of the ongoing criminal investigation and stated, \u201cWe operate according to regulations. No authority has informed us of any violations.\u201d\n\nRTL Nieuws reached out to the healthcare providers that worked with Samen-Zorgzaam.

They say, \u201cThat's improv! That's not stand-up.\u201d And I'm like, well, then call me an improv.\n\nI just prefer to have fun. I need to at least get to know the crowd a little bit, you know?

(Photo by Carmen Mandato/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nUFC 313 takes place at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vages on Saturday, March 8.\n\nUFC 313 Main Event: Alex Pereira Vs. Magomed Ankalaev\n\nAlex Pereira (12-2) began 2023 by losing his UFC middleweight title to Israel Adesanya by knockout. In July, Pereira followed that setback with a win over former UFC light heavyweight title holder, Jan B\u0142achowicz, in his UFC debut at 205 pounds. He finished the year by knocking out ex-UFC light heavyweight kingpin Ji\u0159\u00ed Proch\u00e1zka at UFC 295 to claim the vacant UFC 205-pound title.\n\nPereira made his first defense of his crown in April when he knocked out(another) ex-UFC light heavyweight champ, Jamahal Hill, in the first round of their UFC 300 matchup. Pereira showed his power is on another level, when he finished Hill 3:14 into the first round of the main event of UFC 300.\n\nIn June, on very short notice, the UFC called on Pereira and Proch\u00e1zka to headline UFC 303 when the Conor McGregor vs. Michael Chandler fight fell off that card.\n\nAfter the bout, which Pereira won via a knockout 13 seconds into the second stanza, I wrote:\n\n\u201cPereira showed that his first win over Prochazka wasn\u2019t a fluke. The UFC light heavyweight champ is a fearsome fighter who packs a lot of power in his strikes, but he\u2019s also an extremely focused competitor who doesn't let anything bother him.\n\n\u201cPereira effectively scored two knockouts on Saturday night, blasting former champion Jiri Prochazka to the mat at the bell to end the first round and then sending him right back down in the opening moments of the second round with a head kick.\u201d\n\nIn August the UFC booked Pereira against Khalil Rountree Jr for the main event of UFC 307, which took place on October 5. Pereira outclassed Rountree, putting a beating on his opponent before scoring a fourth-round TKO win.\n\nPereira picked up his third UFC title defense of 2024 on Saturday night. Pereira let his opponent, Khalil Rountree Jr, tire himself out in the early going of the fight while simultaneously slowing him with powerful kicks to Rountree's lead leg. Pereira picked up the pace in the third round, fighting very effectively behind his jab. That jab opened up several nasty cuts around Rountree's eye and on the bridge of his nose. Those blows hurt Rountree, and once Pereira had Rountree fading, he picked him apart with precision and power, forcing the referee, Marc Goddard, to stop the fight in the fourth round. Goddard could have stopped this much sooner.\n\nPereira was in the running for fighter of the year for 2024.\n\nLAS VEGAS, NEVADA - JANUARY 13: Magomed Ankalaev of Russia reacts against Johnny Walker of Brazil in ... [+] a light heavyweight fight during the UFC Fight Night event at UFC APEX on January 13, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo by Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images)\nZuffa LLC via Getty Images\n\nMagomed Ankalaev (19-1-1-1) has been a member of the UFC roster since 2018. Ankalaev lost his UFC debut when Paul Craig submitted him at 4:59 of the third round. Since then, Ankalaev has gone 13 fights without a loss.\n\nAnkalaev secured a title fight in December 2022 when he faced former UFC champion Jan Blachowicz for the vacant light heavyweight crown. However, that contest ended in a split draw, and with neither man impressing the matchmakers in that matchup, the UFC opted not to give either man a second go at earning the belt.\n\nSince then, Ankalaev is 2-0-0-1 with a no contest (illegal knee) against Johnny Walker, and most recently a decision win over Aleksandar Rakic at UFC 308.\n\nWhen the UFC opted to give UFC light heavyweight champion Alex Pereira a fight against Khalil Rountree at UFC 307 and bypass Ankalaev, he felt snubbed by the promotion, but also motivated.\n\n\u201cNow everybody knows I'm not fighting for the title and will fight Rakic in Abu Dhabi. Whoever (UFC matchmaker) Mick Maynard gives me I will smash their face so that they can no longer deny me if I do my job impressively. I feel sorry for whoever is gonna fight me from now going forward,\u201d Ankalaev said at the time.\n\nNot long after that, Ankalaev said that Pereira was running from him. He gets the chance to face Pereira on March 8.\n\nUFC Schedule March 2025: UFC 313 Full Fight Card\n\nUFC 313 PPV Card\n\nAlex Pereira vs. Magomed Ankalaev\n\nJustin Gaethje vs. Rafael Fiziev\n\nJalin Turner vs. Ignacio Bahamondes\n\nAmanda Lemos vs. Iasmin Lucindo\n\nKing Green vs. Maur\u00edcio Ruffy\n\nUFC 313 Preliminary Card\n\nCurtis Blaydes vs. Rizvan Kuniev\n\nJoshua Van vs. Rei Tsuruya\n\nBrunno Ferreira vs. Armen Petrosyan\n\nAlex Morono vs. Carlos Leal\n\nUFC 313 Early Preliminary Card\n\nMairon Santos vs. Francis Marshall\n\nDjorden Santos vs. Ozzy Diaz\n\nUFC Schedule March 2025: UFC Vegas 104 Fight Card\n\nLONDON, ENGLAND - MARCH 17: (L-R) Opponents Marvin Vettori of Italy and Roman Dolidze of Georgia ...

Lawmakers\u2019 focus on reining in the cost of housing is well-founded.\n\nThe National Association of Realtors estimated in 2021 that nationwide 5.5 million new housing units are needed to meet current demand. Freddie Mac, meanwhile, estimated the housing shortage at 3.8 million units in 2020, while the National Association of Homebuilders estimated the shortage at 1.5 million units in 2021. The Brookings Institute, using an adaptation of Freddie Mac\u2019s methodology, projected that the U.S. housing shortage as Q4 2023 varied \u201cbetween 3.4 million and 6.4 million units, depending upon the choice of model and vacancy rate.\u201d\n\nThough bills to reduce income tax rates and expand school choice are being filed predominately in red states, reforms aimed at making housing more affordable are gaining traction in both red and blue states. Indicating the potential for bipartisan cooperation on the matter, President Donald Trump and Kamala Harris both lamented on the 2024 campaign trail how regulations inflate the cost to build new housing. Though escalating housing costs are getting attention from national politicians, however, most of the policy remedies for addressing the matter must be implemented not by Congress or the White House, but by state legislatures, city halls, and county commissions.\n\nGovernors and legislators recognize that when it comes to making their state as attractive as possible to prospective and existing residents, keeping housing costs down is as important as keeping tax burdens in check. \u201cWhat matters to movers the most is housing affordability in the destination state,\u201d says the National Association of Realtors.\n\n\u201cStates with higher median property value had fewer people moving into them in 2022. In fact, states with the highest property values\u2014Hawaii ($846,470), California ($740,140), and the District of Columbia ($722,318)\u2014all experienced net migration losses, with California losing the most people that year,\u201d the NAR added. \u201cThese are crucial results, as they indicate that people would be willing to compromise on employment opportunities to move to a place where they can afford to buy housing.\u201d\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nPhysical Attacks Against Bitcoin Holders Surge As BTC Price Rises\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For P.J. Tucker After Raptors Waive Former NBA Champion?\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers Prove That The East Runs Through Them\n\nIn recent months and years, governors and state legislators have successfully implemented reforms that aim to mitigate housing costs by making it less costly and time consuming to construct new housing. In particular, recent state-level reforms that remove or ease local regulations that restrict the supply of housing, such as the set of reforms Montana Governor Greg Gianforte (R) enacted in 2023, are being considered in more states in 2025.\n\nGovernor Gianforte signed into law a series of bills in 2023 that preempt local zoning restrictions blocking the construction of new housing in Montana. One of the bills Governor Gianforte signed, Senate Bill 323, overrides local single-family zoning restrictions in cities and towns with more than 5,000 residents to permit the construction of duplexes. Another bill Gianforte enacted, SB 528, preempts all local prohibitions or restrictions on the construction of accessory dwelling units (ADUs), such as a carriage houses, guest cottages, and pool houses. Similar reforms have been enacted in California, Virginia, Colorado, and Utah.\n\nAt the beginning of 2024, however, the implementation of SB 323 and SB 528 was held up when a judge in Bozeman, where the median home price now exceeds $800,000, issued a preliminary injunction. Governor Gianforte, state legislators, and those who want to increase the supply of housing subsequently celebrated the September decision by the Montana Supreme Court to lift that injunction, which allowed the 2023 housing reforms to move forward.\n\n\u201cI appreciate the Montana Supreme Court for rejecting this injunction, which held back two key reforms identified by our bipartisan Housing Task Force and passed into law by the Legislature,\u201d Governor Gianforte said in September. \u201cWe will continue to find innovative ideas to increase housing supply so that affordable, attainable housing is within reach for every Montanan.\u201d\n\nLegislation to preempt local zoning restrictions that prevent new construction or increase the cost of construction have been introduced but not yet enacted in other fast-growing states, such as Texas and North Carolina. The Texas Senate already passed a local zoning preemption bill in 2023 like the one enacted in Montana the prior year, but it did not get out of the Texas House.\n\nReducing Regulatory Barriers To New Construction Is Top 2025 Priority for Lone Star State Leaders\n\nHigh housing costs remain a top challenge facing state legislators in Texas, who kicked off their biennial legislative session in January. Based on a change in the composition of the Texas House, a series of conservative reforms that have passed out of the Texas Senate numerous times only to die in the House, such as the aforementioned zoning reforms approved in 2023, are now set to at last reach Governor Greg Abbott\u2019s (R) desk in 2025.\n\nAside from the expansion of school choice and further property tax relief, another top 2025 priority announced in January by Lt. Governor Dan Patrick (R), who presides over the Texas Senate, is \u201cRemoving Barriers to Affordable Housing.\u201d Before adjourning the regular session this spring, Lt. Governor Patrick and his colleagues are expected to approve zoning reforms that protect property rights, streamline the permitting process, and preempt local rules that impede construction of new housing.\n\n\u201cAccording to Comptroller Hegar, Texas is more than 300,000 housing units short of addressing the last decade\u2019s massive population growth,\u201d Texas Public Policy Foundation\u2019s John Bonura and Elle Cole wrote in a February 4 op-ed. \u201cThis shortage has been exacerbated by policies that restrict the supply of housing, prompting high prices that have reached a point where 74% of Texans cannot afford a median-priced newly constructed home.\u201d\n\nBonura and Cole highlighted recent comments by Lt. Governor Patrick, in which he said \u201cwe have to get cities to allow us to build more affordable housing by looking at lot sizes, what we can do with multiple housing in an area\u2026right now in some of our bigger cities, our school teachers and policemen and firemen who work in those cities can\u2019t even afford to live there.\u201d\n\nTennessee Reform Expedites The Permitting Process\n\nA reform enacted by Tennessee Governor Bill Lee (R) in 2024 provides an example of another way in which state legislators can reduce construction costs, one that doesn\u2019t involve preemption. Governor Bill Lee (R) and Tennessee legislators enacted a bill last year that allows developers to hire their own inspectors. That reform also allows builders to hire a wetlands consultant to conduct permit reviews if the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation is unable to do so within 30 days of application.\n\n\u201cJust take it from someone who spent 35 years in the construction industry,\u201d Governor Lee said about the need for that 2024 reform. \u201cA bureaucratic permitting process is bad for everybody but the government.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Kevin Vaughan (R) noted that this reform allows builders to say \u201chey we\u2019re going to use our own folks on this because we know the timelines are so backed up.\u201d While such a reform can speed up the permitting process and prevent delays from impeding development in other states, some have pointed out that such a reform would be particularly useful in Los Angeles, where thousands of residents are working to rebuild homes, stores, and offices in the aftermath of the recent fires.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how there is any alternative to allowing applicants to hire third party permit reviewers and inspectors,\u201d Nolan Gray, senior director of California YIMBY and professional city planner, noted in a January 9 post on X. \u201cLADBS is already massively backed up, and we already have a housing shortage.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order on January 27 suspending permitting requirements that would delay rebuilding in areas affected by the wildfires. Newsom also ordered the California Coastal Commission to refrain from issuing guidance or taking actions that conflict with that executive order.\n\n\u201cAs the state helps the Los Angeles area rebuild and recover, we will continue to remove barriers and red tape that stand in the way,\" Newsom said. \u201cWe will not let over-regulation stop us from helping the LA community rebuild and recover.\u201d\n\nNewsom\u2019s statements and actions in the aftermath of the Los Angeles fires are the first instance of a sitting Democratic governor of California acknowledging that California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) mandates and Coastal Commission regulations inflate the cost of housing and make it harder to bring new units online.\n\nSuch an admission from Newsom will make it harder for Golden State lawmakers to justify keeping CEQA mandates, as they current exist, in place for everyone moving forward. Should CEQA persist as is even after this gubernatorial admission of its inflationary effects, that would indicate environmental pressure groups have not seen their influence in Sacramento diminished that much.\n\n\u201cNewsom\u2019s executive actions are admissions that the two laws they target--CEQA and the California Coastal Act--need to be completely overhauled,\u201d Lanhee Chen, a Hoover Institute fellow and former candidate for California State Controller, wrote in a post on X. \u201cIf they can be so easily waived in times of emergency, why should Californians have to deal with the regulatory headaches they cause otherwise?\u201d\n\nBack in Washington, D.C., two dozen members of Congress formed the YIMBY caucus after last November\u2019s election. Congressman Robert Garcia (D-Calif.), a member of that caucus, said its formation demonstrates that the need to increase the supply of housing is an issue \u201cwhere Democrats and Republicans agree\u201d and that federal lawmakers of all ideological stripes \u201cunderstand that building housing is critically important.\u201d Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.), meanwhile, has introduced the Yes In My Backyard (YIMBY) Act, which makes federal funding for states and localities contingent up the enactment of reforms that allow property owners to build more housing.\n\nRecent actions and statements by both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill underscore how high housing costs have become one of the top challenges facing many U.S. households. While most of the reform work that is needed to remedy this problem must occur at the state level, based on legislation that has been both filed and already enacted in a number of states states, it\u2019s clear that beyond bipartisan recognition of the problem there is also some cross-ideological agreement about the optimal policy solutions.\n\nFollow me on Twitter.\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades", "summary": "Lawmakers and governors in many states this year are aiming to bring down housing costs, namely by protecting property rights in a way that facilitates new construction.", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickgleason/2025/02/28/governors-and-legislators-take-on-local-impediments-to-new-housing/", "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67c1e22e9c355c42cd8447df/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 04:58:32", "author": "Contributor,Michael Ciaglo,Patrick Gleason", "authors": ["Contributor", "Michael Ciaglo", "Patrick Gleason"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.003}, {"id": 295535894, "title": "Meet \u2018Weegee The Famous,\u2019 New York\u2019s Revolutionary Street Photographer", "text": "Weegee, [St. Louis Gag Shot], ca. 1950, International Center of Photography. Bequest of Wilma ... [+] Wilcox, 1993 (20531.1993)\n\u00a9 International Center of Photography/Getty Images\n\nIn the 1930s, Ukrainian \u00e9migr\u00e9 Arthur Felig (aka \"Weegee\" or \u201cWeegee the Famous\u201d) would stay up all night roaming the streets of New York in search of accidents and crimes to photograph. With an almost possessed zeal, he would seek out these often grisly scenes, and would shoot them from unusual angles, often capturing not only the event, but the crowds surrounding it as well. As a freelancer, he would develop his photographs on the move, and sell them to the newspapers early in the morning. This start as a press photographer led him to cover mob violence, cross-dressers (then illegal), fights, car crashes, fires and more of the entropy and vivaciousness of the big city.\n\nStephanie Monohan at Screen Slate said,\n\nWhat stands out about his work, however, is his emphasis on people\u2019s emotional responses to scenes of tragedy and grotesquerie. While most photographers swarmed the same stretch of sidewalk, hurrying to get the same shot of a crime scene or car accident, Weegee pointed his lens at the faces of onlookers; in turn, capturing their excitement, horror, and grief.\n\nWeegee, Photographers at Premiere, ca. 1951, International Center of Photography. Bequest of Wilma ... [+] Wilcox, 1993 (18802.1993)\n\u00a9 International Center of Photography/Getty Images\n\nBy the 1940s, Weegee had moved to Hollywood and taken up work shooting the stars. He worked for Life and Vogue, crafting distorted, playful portraits of President John F. Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe. Weegee also contributed the still photography to Stanley Kubrick\u2019s Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964).\n\nBut he also had an artistic practice later in his career where he showed off his outsized personality and creativity, often using kaleidoscopes, prisms, and other tricks to produce experimental photos. His underground films and early experimental documentaries took cues from Dada and Surrealism to show New York not as a glamorous city of jewels, but rather a diverse, complex city with many different viewpoints. His short film Weegee\u2019s New York (1948) was a notable contribution to the \u201cCity Symphony\u201d canon of the post-war period, while his photography book Naked City (1945) was the basis for a movie of the same title, considered an early film noir.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nPhysical Attacks Against Bitcoin Holders Surge As BTC Price Rises\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For P.J.

But the divide between the Ukrainian leader and the Trump White House has ballooned in recent days as talks over a much-anticipated minerals deal for joint development of Ukraine\u2019s natural resources got bogged down.\nThe extraordinary moment that unfolded in front of TV cameras on Friday marked a potential turning point in Washington\u2019s relationship with Moscow.\nIn recent weeks, Trump has already upended decades of US foreign policy by publicly siding with the Russian leader, saying he \u201ctrusts\u201d President Vladimir Putin is sincere in his desire to end the war \u2013 a belief that most Western officials, including intelligence officials, rebuke.\nThe conversation in the Oval Office on Friday began with the usual pleasantries but began to go downhill after Vice-President J.D. Vance accused Zelensky of being ungrateful for US support. Minutes later, it escalated into an unprecedented shouting match where Trump and Vance berated the Ukrainian wartime president.\nTwo White House officials said there was no attempt to ambush Zelensky and that they thought Friday\u2019s visit would be a win for Trump, with Zelensky expected to sign the minerals agreement.\nHowever, the outburst did not come out of the blue, three people with knowledge of the matter said.\nFrustration has mounted inside the White House in recent weeks, particularly as Trump officials attempted to negotiate the minerals deal with Ukraine, the sources said.\nIn recent days, the exasperation among the White House officials risked derailing Zelensky\u2019s visit. \u201cI don\u2019t see why an invitation would make sense,\u201d one White House official said on Wednesday, when the Ukrainian president appeared to waver on signing the deal.\n\nWhile a subsequent agreement was later reached for Zelensky to fly to the United States, Trump had other frustrations.\nIn recent weeks, the Republican president told his closest advisers that he does not like the way in which Zelensky has tried to drum up US support for Ukraine, claiming he used showmanship to try and win points with the media and Congress.\nHe also spoke to his national security team about the future of Zelensky\u2019s time in office \u2013 and whether the US could force elections in Ukraine through peace negotiations, according to two sources.\nTrump has already openly pushed for elections in Ukraine and blasted Zelensky for not holding them after his official five-year term ran out in 2024. Russia has cited this in the past to assert that he is an illegitimate leader.\nUkrainian legislation prohibits holding elections during a state of martial law, which Ukraine declared the day Russia invaded in February 2022. Trump has falsely claimed that Zelensky has an approval rating of 4 per cent. A poll this month put Zelensky\u2019s approval ratings at 63 per cent.\nThe Republican president has also directed his team to limit communications as much as possible with Zelensky\u2019s top aide Andriy Yermak, who had held a close working relationship with former Democratic president Joe Biden\u2019s security adviser Jake Sullivan.\nSpeaking to reporters outside the White House after Friday\u2019s drama, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters he warned Zelensky before the meeting to focus on the agreement at hand and to put off discussing security guarantees and a ceasefire until later.\n\u201cI talked to Volodymyr Zelensky this morning \u2013 don\u2019t take the bait.

He defended that belt with two knockouts before knocking out Jes\u00fas Cuellar in the third round in their 2018 bout to capture the WBA super featherweight title. Then, in 2019, the Baltimore-born fighter moved to lightweight to fight Yuriorkis Gamboa for the vacant WBA (regular) lightweight title. Davis won that contest by TKO in the 12th round. Davis then defeated Leo Santa Cruz in 2020 by sixth-round knockout in a scrap that was for the WBA lightweight and WBA super featherweight belts. In December 2021, following a TKO over Mario Barrios in June 2021, Davis faced Isaac Cruz for the WBA lightweight strap. That contest went 12 rounds, with Davis winning via unanimous decision. Davis is 4-0 since the win over Cruz, beating Rolando Romero, Hector Garcia, Ryan Garcia, and most recently Frank Martin via knockout.\n\nDavis and Roach were initially booked to meet in December at Toyota Center in Houston, Texas, but that fight was postponed and moved to New York in November.

Roach Breakdown\n\nDavis does an excellent job using his lead hand as a probe. With that hand, he judges distance while also looking to distract his opponent. Then, when Davis has the position he wants, he unloads with a power left. Davis can be countered when he lets his probe hang, but he has the speed and smarts to counter his opponent's counter. However, that is a risky proposition, and not one a fighter should rely on to score consistently. Davis is also very good at drawing out his opponent with feints. Look for the champ to use level changes to get his opponent to bite on those movements to get information on timing and tendencies so that he can score the head or body with power punches.\n\nWhen it comes to defense, Davis has remarkable speed. He employs several countering techniques to make his opponents pay for their missed offense.\n\nIt's no secret that the pick in this fight is Davis to win via knockout. He might score that stoppage by catching Roach when he reaches in to score a power punch. Another way Davis might score is that Roach can rush in to close range with little concern for defense.\n\nRoach fights behind a more active jab than Davis, but he uses the lead hand in much the same way. The problem for Roach in this matchup is that he doesn't possess the power of the lightweight champion. Roach could have success with his jab, especially if he uses it to counter the probes from Davis's lead hand. Roach needs to be aware of Davis's feints. His best bet in these moments is to step out of range, but he cannot retreat on a straight line.\n\nRoach's main power counter is his uppercut. While this technique is extremely effective when it lands when Roach misses, he leaves himself open for a counter. Roach cannot leave his head hanging out there for a power puncher like Davis.\n\nDavis is two inches shorter than Roach. That means Roach will have the chance to catch Davis when he steps into his jabs, which he tends to do because of his size. Roach must be aware of this because Davis doesn't spend too much time off balance in these situations. In other words, he knows what he is doing in these moments and makes up for his lack of size with defense.\n\nWe will have more on tonight\u2019s Davis vs. Roach fight card during today\u2019s event, including full fight card results, reactions, video highlights and more.\n\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades", "summary": "Everything you need to know about tonight's Gervonta 'Tank'Davis Vs.

Enhanced with lights, sounds, scents, and smoke, the whimsical show has attracted a steady crowd since opening in 2017.\n\nThen there\u2019s Aerobanquets RMX, an immersive dining experience inspired by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and L.C. Fillia\u2019s 1932 work, The Futurist Cookbook, designed by Mattia Casalegno. Nearly a decade ago, the Italian multimedia artist began tinkering with motion-capture cameras in hopes of finding a way to integrate taste and flavor into his works. \u201cI saw VR as a way to extend the capability of what we can see, hear, feel and taste in real life,\u201d he notes. \u201cIt\u2019s very visceral and allows you to tell stories that couldn\u2019t be told otherwise.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, Casalegno introduced the rough concept to Roni Mazumdar, CEO of Unapologetic Foods. The renowned restaurateur\u2014whose portfolio counts some of New York\u2019s most celebrated Indian restaurants, including Adda, Dhamaka, and Semma\u2014was skeptical at first. \u201cI thought, \u2018God, this is going to be an abomination,\u2019\u201d he admits. \u201cBut then I was blown away.\u201d\n\nTogether, the pair began experimenting on how to refine the crude concept, tapping Mazumdar\u2019s longtime chef-partner, Chintan Pandya, to create the accompanying menu. \u201cWe were just having fun,\u201d Mazumdar laughs, recalling how they initially set up shop in the private room of one of his old restaurants (now home to Semma).\n\nItalian artist Mattia Casalegno's Aerobanquets RMX offered guests a first-of-its-kind culinary ... [+] experience featuring bites created by Unapologetic Foods chef and cofounder, Chintan Pandya.\nDavid Chow / James Beard Foundation\n\nThe following year, they pitched Aerobanquets RMX to Mitchell Davis, then an executive at the James Beard Foundation. \u201cI thought, \u2018Wow\u2014what a crazy, wonderful idea,\u2019\u201d Davis recalls.

He became famous by his ... [+] influential book The Wealth of Nations.\nBettmann Archive\n\nAdam Smith, though better known now as an economist held the chair of Moral Philosophy at Glasgow and as such it\u2019s fair to assume that he knew a thing or two about the intersection of economics, philosophy and politics, and that often a political crisis is motivated by an underlying economic crisis.\n\nSmith lived during a time of mercantilism, which we might describe as a nationalistic approach to trade that aims to maximise the exports of a country whilst keeping imports to a minimum. In this context, Smith wrote of mercantilist nations that \u2018their interest lies in beggaring their neighbours\u2019, and the phrase \u2018beggar thy neighbour\u2019 has been often used in the economic context, usually when growth is scarce (the aftermath of the Great Depression and the Global Financial crisis)\n\nWith mercantilism and \u2018beggar thy neighbour\u2019 back in fashion, it is worth returning to Smith\u2019s \u2018Wealth of Nations, book IV\u2019 where many of the observations Smith made chime with America today, such as:\n\n\u2018The sneaking arts of underling tradesmen are thus erected into political maxims for the conduct of a great empire ... . By such maxims as these, however, nations have been taught that their interest consisted in beggaring all their neighbours. Each nation has been made to look with an invidious eye upon the prosperity of all the nations with which it trades, and to consider their gain as its own loss. Commerce, which ought naturally to be, among nations, as among individuals, a bond of union and friendship, has become the most fertile source of discord and animosity\u2019.\n\nTo that end, beyond the bonfire of American values and diplomatic relationships, there is an emerging, underlying logic to the policies of the White House that China, Japan and Europe need to pay attention to.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nPhysical Attacks Against Bitcoin Holders Surge As BTC Price Rises\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For P.J. Tucker After Raptors Waive Former NBA Champion?\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers Prove That The East Runs Through Them\n\nI have written many times in this note that the world economy is in the antechamber of a fiscal-debt crisis (listen to \u2018Waking up to World Debt\u2019). Unusually, all of the major economies have become indebted at the same time, and the process(es) by which they try to reduce debt at the same time will likely prove extremely hazardous financially.\n\nIt seems that the Trump entourage understands this, and that logically the unifying factor behind disparate policies from the creation of \u2018DOGE\u2019 to the enfeebling of NATO are driven by a brutal sense of austerity, that starts with the cutting down of all the international public goods that the US has invested in since Bretton Woods.\n\nIn this context, the \u2018beggaring\u2019 of Europe pushes the bill for European security back across the Atlantic and has shaped the debate in Europe towards greater debt accumulation (for example the debt brake is one of the most contentious topics for the new German government and the EU will soon embark on the issue of EU defence bonds). Japan, South Korea and Australia might be next.\n\nIn effect, the White House is using areas where America is exceptional \u2013 financial markets, the military and multinationals \u2013 to coerce its allies. Debt might be next.\n\nThe closest we have to a template for a Trump grand macro plan is a paper written by Stephen Miran, who may soon take up the role of head of the Council for Economic Advisers. The elements in this plan have popularly become known as the \u2018Mar-A-Lago Accord\u2019, which is not unlike the world debt conference idea I have written about in The Levelling, though my version takes place in the recently refurbished Raffles (Singapore).\n\nOne of the pillars of the cited \u2018Mar-A-Lago Accord is that holders of Treasuries exchange these securities for very long-term loans (that might not provide a coupon). The result would be to restructure the maturity and fiscal burden of America\u2019s debt load. It is a neat idea but will not work in practice. Any debt accord will likely need the impetus of a major financial crisis as a motivator, will need to restructure the debt of all the major economies and will entail a rewriting of financial regulations across the world (for pension funds for example).\n\nIn reality, an attempt to enact a Mar-a-Lago Accord, in the same fashion as the debate around NATO, may create aversion (distrust in) to US financial assets and the dollar. Whilst Europeans may not appreciate the extent to which a \u2018beggar thy neighbour\u2019 philosophy is driven by US security policy, the White House is underestimating the value that America\u2019s wide ranging financial, diplomatic and commercial infrastructure bring it. An example is that close to 40% of the revenues of large American firms come from overseas.\n\nIn the short-term, we are also starting to witness the effects of austerity on the American economy. Though \u2018hard\u2019 data on the economy remain solid, the outlook will become very noisy in the next few months as government job cuts take hold and as social welfare cuts (notably in the mortgage industry) sow anxiety. Markets have started to become jittery too, amidst a belief that the administration is much more focused on lowering bond yields (and thus the cost of government debt) than boosting the stock market.\n\nIn a scenario where the (US) economy weakens, investors normally turn to Treasuries, but the prospect of a Mar-A-Lago Accord being foisted upon them could lead to a buyers\u2019 strike.\n\nFollow me on LinkedIn.\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades", "summary": "The world economy is in the antechamber of a fiscal-debt crisis.

However, with a new Treasury Secretary confirmed (i.e. Scott Bessent), a new IRS Commissioner nominated but not yet confirmed (i.e. Billy Long), federal funding cuts, a federal hiring freeze, and employee reductions at both IRS and the Department of Justice Tax Division those initiatives may have just run out of gas.\n\nThe Double-Edged Sword Of Partnership Taxation\n\nThe government has an interest in increasing economic activity and that can be accomplished by removing potential roadblocks like burdensome regulation and undesirable tax consequences. Another way to encourage economic activity is to make business activity more flexible and tax friendly. Partnerships allow business ventures incredible flexibility in structuring the economics of a wide variety of commercial deals. However, that flexibility also allows for a lot of misuse of rules to obtain results that do not reflect the true economics of the deal. Many of the transactions challenged by the IRS or the Department of Justice involve partnerships because they are, by design, the easiest entity to manipulate. During my own tenure at the Department of Justice I was involved in nationwide enforcement efforts against multiple transactions, considered by the government to be abusive, involving partnerships. As a private attorney, partnerships are often the appropriate solution to complicated transactions requiring a flexibility not available with the use of other entities. Whether a transaction is abusive or legitimate is often in the details.\n\nThe usual mechanism for testing the details of transactions and the potential tax benefits of those transactions is during the IRS audit process. Historically, however, the IRS has been terrible at auditing partnerships. When the IRS released its Strategic Operating Plan in May of 2024 it indicated increasing audits for wealthy taxpayers, large corporations, and partnerships. That announcement indicated a \u201cten-fold\u201d increase for large complex partnerships but that increase would be from 0.1% in 2019 to 1% by 2026. According to a U.S. General Accountability Office (GAO) study indicated that large partnerships increased 600% between 2002 and 2019 but the audit rate continued to decline. The IRS blamed the declining audit rate to resource constraints. Further, the no-change results for the few partnerships audited are double those for large corporate taxpayers and the GAO study attributes the poor selection to statistical models used. This poor selection process isn\u2019t only bad for the public fisc, but costs an unnecessary number of compliant partnerships the time and money required for an audit to merely confirm that everything is in order.\n\nFixing Old Problems With New Partnership Audit Rules\n\nThe Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) created new rules for auditing partnerships that were applicable for tax years starting in 2018, unless you could meet the narrow circumstances allowing election out of the new rules. The goal of the new audit rules was to provide a more favorable framework for the audit of partnerships and improve the historically poor rate and performance experienced in IRS audits of partnerships. Tax advisors have been helping partnership amend their agreements, implement new internal controls, and otherwise adjust their businesses to account for a potential IRS audit. However, as Mike Tyson indicated before his fight with Evander Holyfield, \u201ceverybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\u201d\n\nSome taxpayers are discovering that the IRS rule that only one \u201cpartnership representative\u201d participates and is authorized to bind the entire partnership during the audit can cause unfavorable results. Minority partners and the partnerships they are involved in are struggling to navigate the longer and more complicated audit process, properly account for adjustments, use push-out elections, and otherwise navigate the complexities of the new audit rules. It appears clear that there are still a lot of growing pains for this new system of audit rules and many questions are going to be resolved through litigation. That litigation is already just beginning and will now occur in an environment of reduced general and enforcement funding for the IRS and Department of Justice. The government, with limited resources and funding, will likely need to choose its battles wisely and some disputes may just not be worth the cost of full litigation in Tax Court or the Federal District Courts. While this might be welcome news for individual taxpayers, it leaves other taxpayers without guidance needed to navigate transactional issues that arise in the partnership context.\n\nPre-Trump Administration Focus On Basis Shifting\n\nBefore the new Trump administration took over the IRS issued guidance indicating a focus on certain basis shifting transactions used by partnerships it believed were abusive. On June 17, 2024, The IRS issued guidance indicating that the IRS examination teams were seeing \u201csophisticated maneuvers by related-party partnerships\u201d they believed were generating inappropriate tax benefits. These alleged \u201cmaneuvers\u201d involved related party transfers of partnership interests, distributions of property, and liquidations of partnerships or partners. The proposed regulations, issued around the same time, would classify these \u201cbasis shifting\u201d transactions as transactions of interest with disclosure obligations for those transactions backed up by penalties for failure to make the required disclosures. The partnership basis focus also included a Revenue Ruling indicating that the IRS would challenge certain transactions it labeled as \u201cbasis stripping\u201d transactions. Also issued around that time was IRS Notice 2024-54, which announced two sets of upcoming regulations that were also intended to curb certain transactions the IRS believed were resulting in inappropriate tax benefits and treatment.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nPhysical Attacks Against Bitcoin Holders Surge As BTC Price Rises\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For P.J. Tucker After Raptors Waive Former NBA Champion?\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers Prove That The East Runs Through Them\n\nThe proposed regulations for disclosure of certain allegedly abusive transactions may never get finalized under the more hostile regulatory environment. The current administration has made it a priority to not only reduce the overall size of government but also decrease the amount of regulation. For example, on January 31, 2025 President Trump signed the executive order \u201cUnleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation\u201d requiring the repeal of 10 regulations for every new regulation proposed. The \u201cupcoming regulations\u201d may never be released given that they would now require the removal of another 20 regulations already on the books according to the recent Trump Executive Order on deregulation. All that is left of the previous partnership initiatives are outlines of alleged abusive activity and threats of action with a much smaller or potentially non-existent stick to enforce those threats.\n\nEnforcement resources at the IRS and DOJ in 2025 appear to be set to get worse, not better, and so the planned increase in audit rates for large partnerships and enforcement of abusive basis structures seems unlikely. Trump\u2019s Executive Order creating the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) specifically requires \u201clarge-scale reductions in force\u201d and other provisions that will certainly result in more scaling back of the personnel and resources originally planned for partnership enforcement efforts. Whether this will lead to more abusive behavior by partnerships or not remains to be seen. Although threats were made in 2024, the ability to make good on those threats has certainly diminished in 2025 and appear to decrease with every passing day.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades", "summary": "Tax enforcement against partnerships was a priority of the IRS in 2024, but Trump's Treasury Department may not have the funding. personnel, or enthusiasm for such enforcement anymore.", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuasmeltzer/2025/03/01/will-trumps-treasury-department-continue-partnership-tax-focus/", "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67c298c70192939fe3c2ea7c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2797,1312,x0,y432,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 05:20:25", "author": "Contributor,Joshua D.

And why the cessation of aid, under current President Donald Trump, is so vexing to friends of a free Ukraine.\n\nUkraine \u201cneeds lots and lots of 155-millimeter shells,\u201d wrote Michael Shurkin, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London. Can Ukraine keep its big guns firing as Trump aligns the United States with Russia and halts further U.S. aid to Ukraine?\n\nFortunately for Ukraine, the answer is a qualified\u2014and complicated\u2014yes. Separate Czech, Estonian, German and Norwegian initiatives, among others, should keep Ukraine\u2019s best 155-millimeter howitzers blasting away, even as stockpiles of American shells run out.\n\nSince February 2022, Ukraine has received around 900 155-millimeter howitzers from its allies as well as millions of shells for these towed and self-propelled guns, each of which lobs a 100-pound shell 15 miles or farther. The Ukrainians have lost around 200 of the guns to Russian action, but are replacing them with locally made wheeled howitzers at a rate of around 20 new guns a month.\n\nAll told, Ukrainian artillery fires 5,000 or more 155-millimeter rounds every day for an annual total of around 2 million shells. That\u2019s fewer shells than Russian artillery fires, but enough to shatter attacking Russian formations\u2014and make them pay dearly in troops and vehicles for every yard they advance.\n\nUkrainian artillery.\nUkrainian defense ministry photo\n\nArtillery politics\n\nUnder Biden, the United States donated more than 3 million 155-millimeter shells, many of them straight from the main U.S. Army shell factory in Pennsylvania, which has been ramping up production from a per-war rate of 14,000 155-millimeter rounds a month to a new target of 100,000 rounds a month.\n\nBut amid the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to extort Ukraine\u2019s mineral wealth and a disastrous Oval Office press conference on Friday, in which Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance berated a bewildered Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for not being sufficiently grateful for past U.S. aid, the White House is threatening to completely shut off munitions shipments that have already slowed to a trickle since Trump assumed office in January.\n\nAs a visibly shocked Zelensky left the White House on Friday, Ukraine\u2019s European allies voiced their support for the wartime leader. \u201cUkraine can rely on Germany\u2014and on Europe,\u201d wrote German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\nIt\u2019s true, especially as Scholz steps aside and Chancellor-elect Friedrich Merz forms the next German government following his party\u2019s electoral victory last week. Merz has vowed to lead Europe away from reliance on an increasingly autocratic United States and toward \u201cstrategic independence.\u201d\n\nGermany has shipped nearly half a million 155-millimeter shells to Ukraine\u2014and is expanding domestic shell production in order to sustain supplies through 2025. More importantly, German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall has partnered with a Ukrainian firm to build a new factory for 155-millimeter shells in Ukraine\u2014one that should begin producing hundreds of thousands of rounds annually starting next year.\n\nThat factory will join an existing Ukrainian factory, supported by Norway, that is already churning out 155-millimeter shells\u2014albeit at a much lower rate.\n\nFor the next couple of years, however, Ukraine will continue to mostly rely on imported artillery ammo. As U.S. aid ends, the biggest sources of shells will be parallel Czech- and Estonian-led initiatives that scour the globe for 155-millimeter rounds and may have even sourced some of them from Indian and South African factories. South Korea is also a major producer of shells and has sold large batches to the United States for onward transfer to Ukraine.\n\nThe Czech initiative delivered 1.5 million shells last year and will continue unless and until the current government loses reelection to pro-Russian parties later this year. The Estonian initiative is just spooling up\u2014and aims to ship 1 million shells in 12 months.\n\nIt\u2019s all a logistical mess, but the bottom line is that Ukraine and its allies have established redundant supply lines for critical artillery and associated ammunition. The Americans may quit the war. But that won\u2019t prevent Ukraine\u2019s biggest guns from firing away for the foreseeable future.\n\nFollow me on Twitter.

Bryce Hill, director of fiscal and economic research at the Illinois Policy Institute, recently highlighted noteworthy fiscal policy trends among the top gainers and losers.\n\nAmong the five states that lost the most population due to domestic net migration last year, \u201cfour of five have progressive state income taxes,\u201d Hill noted in a February 26 post. \u201cIllinois is the exception with its flat state income tax, but some state lawmakers are again trying to change that.\u201d\n\nConversely, as Hill noted, among the five states that gained the most residents last year through domestic migration, four of them have either a flat income tax or no income tax. While Illinois is the outlier flat tax state among the top five population losers last year, South Carolina is the lone state with a progressive income tax among the five states that gained the most population through interstate migration in 2024.\n\nMost top destination states have no or flat income tax structures\nIllinois Policy Institute\n\nWhile legislative leaders in Illinois would like to move from a flat to progressive income tax system, their counterparts in the South Carolina statehouse are interested in doing the opposite. South Carolina House Speaker Murrell Smith (R), Governor Henry McMaster (R), and leading members of the South Carolina Senate have expressed a desire to enact further income tax rate reduction this year that moves the state from a progressive income tax code with a top rate of 6.2% today to a single rate income tax below 4%.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nPhysical Attacks Against Bitcoin Holders Surge As BTC Price Rises\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For P.J. Tucker After Raptors Waive Former NBA Champion?\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers Prove That The East Runs Through Them\n\nRecent developments in other states, including many that already boast lower income tax rates than South Carolina, demonstrate why Palmetto State lawmakers are prudent to pursue income tax rate reduction. The Mississippi Senate, for example, will soon hold a floor vote on a bill cutting the state\u2019s 4% flat income tax rate to 2.99% over the next four years.\n\nThe Mississippi House of Representatives, meanwhile, has already approved their own tax package this year, one that would fully phase out the state income tax, making Mississippi the nation\u2019s ninth no-income-tax state. As legislators in Jackson prepare to work out the differences between the House and Senate tax cut plans over the next month, Governor Tate Reeves (R) recently expressed his preference for the House proposal and a belief that the Senate plan doesn\u2019t go far enough.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get anywhere near eliminating the income tax so it is a non-starter for me!,\u201d Governor Reeves wrote about the Senate tax bill, adding \u201cI\u2019m beginning to believe that there is someone in the Senate that is philosophically opposed to eliminating the income tax.\u201d\n\nNearby in Missouri, Governor Mike Kehoe (R) has also expressed support for phasing out the state income tax. Lawmakers in the Missouri House and Senate, meanwhile, have filed legislation cut the state\u2019s top marginal income tax rate from 4.8% to 4%, with further rate reduction contingent upon revenue triggers being met in the coming years.\n\nBeyond Missouri and Mississippi, income tax cuts have been enacted or are poised for passage in many other states this spring. Meanwhile in North Carolina, which kicked off more than a decade of state income tax rate reduction nationwide in 2013, new evidence has emerged that the multiple rounds of income tax relief enacted there are paying economic dividends.\n\nIn a recent blog post by the Johne Locke Foundation, Brian Balfour, the Raleigh-based think tank\u2019s senior vice president of research, touts a new report from a Democratic-led state department as further proof that the income tax cuts enacted since 2013 are benefitting all North Carolinians, not just the rich as critics contend.\n\n\u201cA new report released by the NC Department of Commerce now shows that the tax cuts of the past dozen years helped to lift hundreds of thousands of North Carolinians out of poverty and reduce poverty at one of the fastest rates in the country,\u201d Balfour wrote.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina\u2019s poverty rate declined from 17.8% in 2013 to 12.8% in 2023, a decrease of five percentage points over the decade,\u201d the North Carolina Department of Commerce noted in its report. \u201cThe state\u2019s progress ranks fifth nationwide in poverty reduction during this period.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis reduction in poverty, according to the report,\u201d Balfour noted, \u201crepresents roughly 360,000 fewer individuals below the poverty line.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe critics of tax cuts have for more than a decade wrongly warned us about massive budget shortfalls due to tax cuts, and now a new report confirms that they are wrong about tax cuts exclusively helping 'the rich\u2019 and big corporations,\u201d Balfour added.\n\nResidents of nine states had a state income tax take effect on the first day of 2025.

The word, referring to an officer of the highest rank in an army or church, derives from a 12th-century French root that is far broader, meaning \u201cof wide application, generic, affecting or involving all\u201d. Could these traits also be seen in another type of general \u2013 the leader of a country?\n\nAround 15 August every year, a number of audio/film clips made during the early days of our nation-state are shared, particularly the seminal \u201cNot wholly or in full measure, but very substantially\u201d speech by Jawaharlal Nehru on the eve of Independence.\n\nTwo years ago, yet another speech by our first prime minister made the rounds that led me to the hypothesis stated above. This was the speech Nehru made on the occasion of laying the foundation stone for the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research on January 1, 1954.\n\nNehru spoke spontaneously, first in Hindustani and then in English, setting out, as he saw it, the purpose of research and the role this institute should play. \u201cWhy is science promoted in recent years?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy is so much money spent on it?\u201d\n\nHe explained the value of scientific pursuit in two ways, one for problem solving, the second, and more fundamental, as a means to understand our world today.\n\nHe used the famous example of Benjamin Franklin, an amateur scientist (also a synonym for a generalist) and a founding father of the American Constitution, who flew a kite in a thunderstorm to divine the nature of electricity. In Nehru\u2019s words, \u201cAasmaan se bijli ko pakad ke laaye.\u201d\n\nOf course, this was a speech given in the Cold War years, and Nehru repeatedly mentions the arms race and the need for India to develop its own weaponry. The developed countries were able to produce sophisticated armaments, because they \u201cserved\u201d science (\u201cVigyaan ki seva kee\u201d).\n\nHe also talked about the ills and the potential positive applications of nuclear power: \u201cHistory teaches us that often the ones who make a revolution become victims of the revolution itself.\u201d\n\nBut what made the speech exceptional was his insistence on unravelling the essence of what he meant by \u2018fundamental\u2019 (buniyadi). In a remarkable bit of exposition, he presented his case both at a philosophical and pragmatic level.\n\nWe might not immediately understand the value of the research being carried out at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, but over time, this new knowledge should benefit all. In a new country that had shrugged off the colonial yoke not 10 years ago, and one that faced myriad immediacies, like war, hunger and resettlement after the Partition, Nehru\u2019s unabashed support to scientists and mathematicians to do their thing without quotidian restraints stands out in its clarity.\n\nThe ease with which he did this tells us about the ease he felt in speaking about subjects that he was not necessarily schooled in. Given our contemporary positions, Nehru should have stuck to his \u201ccore competency\u201d \u2013 law. What could he tell us of fundamental research in the sciences? Was he, as the pejorative goes: a Jack of all trades and a master of none?\n\nThroughout his life, and during his years as prime minister, Nehru exemplified the word generalist. His comfort level with a wide range of issues could be seen in his patronage of a broad swathe of national projects, of which the Indian Institutes of Technology and the Indian Institutes of Management are the most talked about.\n\nWe do tend to forget his role in the setting up of the National Laboratories under the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research, the Atomic Energy Commission, and the Bhakra Nangal Dam, which he famously described as one of the \u201ctemples of modern India\u201d.\n\nHe was the first president of the Sahitya Akademi, inaugurated just two months after the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. His choice to lead it was not based on his post as prime minister, but because he was already seen as a substantial contributor to the world of letters.\n\nNehru was equally at ease in Hollywood and Disneyland, attending film premieres in India and hobnobbing with the glitterati of his time. His interests were wide as his curiosity was deep. Only a generalist by temperament could have dared to write books like Glimpses of World History and The Discovery of India while in prison.\n\nWhat is this generalist mindset? It is one that accepts \u2013 even while seeking to know as much as possible \u2013 the limitations of knowing everything. One important trait is a discomfort with certitudes, and the courage to accept tentativeness as a state of being.\n\nAnother is the wisdom to know that there are multiple ways of looking at any one thing, and the realisation that the present is the result of several iterations of history.\n\nA generalist mindset is not mired in the valorisation of one\u2019s own past. This is reflected in his views about India. Consider these lines he wrote in 1946: \u201cShe [India] was like some palimpsest on which layer upon layer of thought and reverie had been inscribed, and yet no succeeding layer had completely hidden or erased what had been written previously.\u201d\n\nThese thoughts underlie an acceptance of diversity as a necessary state and inclusiveness as an essential for nation building.\n\nA third trait is openness to the shock of the new, the unfamiliar. Le Corbusier, the Swiss-French architect, artist, poet and visionary, was considered one of the finest of the modernist period, but his early training was in watchmaking and the applied arts. He had no experience in city, urban or regional planning.\n\nWhen Nehru hired Le Corbusier to design a new capital city for the Punjab, it was the generalist\u2019s openness at work. Nehru liked the creative approach, not being tied down, as he said in a later speech, by what has been done by our forefathers, but thinking in new terms. In the ultimate analysis, he said, a thing that fits in with the social function is beautiful. His words, delivered to a gathering of architects, describing Le Corbusier\u2019s version of the Capitol Complex in Chandigarh, resonate to this day: \u201cIt is the biggest example in India of experimental architecture\u2026 It hits you on the head and makes you think. You may squirm at the impact but it has made you think and imbibe new ideas, and the one thing that India requires in many fields is being hit on the head so that it may think.\u201d\n\nAs an architect myself, this attitude is an article of faith. A lesson we learnt early in our days as students of architecture and design is that there is no one answer. Design is synthesis, the coming together of various disciplines. Architectural thinking is enriched by all other fields.\n\nAt a pragmatic level, an architect must be ready to design any building, and in order to do so, must have a breadth of knowledge. In essence, s/he must be a generalist. We should know everything about everything, I sometimes tell my students, only half in jest.\n\nInterestingly, the notion of multi-disciplinarity is the flavour of the season, underlined over and again in the New Education Policy. Architects were already comfortable with this approach. From the hard sciences to governance at the level of a country, this piece of advice from science fiction writer Robert A Heinlein needs to be heard and emulated: \u201cA human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyse a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialisation is for insects.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sure Nehru would have approved.\n\nMustansir Dalvi was the longest serving professor of architecture in the University of Mumbai. He is a trustee of Art Deco Mumbai.\n\nThis article first appeared in National Herald and has been reproduced with the permission of the writer.", "summary": "The first Indian prime minister was a generalist, always open to learning while simultaneously aware of the limitations of his knowledge.", "url": "https://scroll.in/magazine/1079749/how-did-nehru-feel-equally-at-ease-in-the-worlds-of-science-architecture-law-and-literature", "image": "https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/206053-cwaufpzral-1740740998.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 01:00:02", "author": "Mustansir Dalvi", "authors": ["Mustansir Dalvi"], "language": "en", "source_country": "IN", "sentiment": 0.153}, {"id": 295493010, "title": "\u2018Heart Lamp\u2019: Banu Mushtaq\u2019s International Booker Prize-longlisted book is charged by women\u2019s anger", "text": "Kannada writer Banu Mushtaq\u2019s book of short stories, translated by Deepa Bhasthi, has been longlisted for this year\u2019s International Booker Prize. A first for both, it is especially exciting since this is Mushtaq\u2019s maiden appearance in English translation. Bhasthi has previously translated a collection of short stories by Kodagina Gouramma \u2013 whose feminist sensibilities struck a chord with readers.\n\nForthcoming in April 2025 by And Other Stories in the UK and Penguin Random House in India, Banu Mushtaq\u2019s discovery should be a celebration for the English language reader. In Heart Lamp: Selected Stories, Bhasthi picks twelve short stories to introduce Mushtaq to a new readership. While the focus is concentrated on the injustices against women predominantly through faith and societal structures, one also discerns the first stirrings of rebellion just under the surface. It is inevitable, the promise is ripe, but one must wait till the tipping point is reached.\n\nWoman, life, freedom\n\nIn each story, Mushtaq builds the tension before it becomes unbearable for her characters and readers. The women are aware that there\u2019s something missing in their lives, though they are not fully aware of the extent of their subjugation. Most are confined within the four walls of their house \u2013 only one story features a working woman \u2013 and their lives are designed to take care of their husband and children. In some cases, the husbands are shown to be \u201cnice\u201d and \u201cloving\u201d and yet they lack an understanding of autonomy, especially when it comes to a woman\u2019s body.\n\nIn Mushtaq\u2019s world, the roles of the provider and the carer are strictly gendered \u2013 no breach is allowed. And some of the men do provide \u2013 they earn enough to raise their several children but are completely blind to the agonies of their wives. As long as the children have clothes on their backs and food in their bellies, there should be no rightful objection to pregnancy. No matter how tedious or even life-threatening it might be.\n\nAlmost every story also advocates strongly for reproductive rights. From semi-educated men to useless louts, their wives know just how much better their lives could be if they were to get the \u201csurgery\u201d done. Men are staunchly against using contraceptives (it has something to do with their interpretation of the Qu\u2019ran) so women have no choice but to take matters into their own hands. Even so, the men are discouraging of the procedure lest their virility come into question. Time and again they remind their wives, that a new baby is welcome for as long as the father is able to provide for it.\n\nMisplaced machismo and false acts of generosity come at a heavy price to the women as we see in the opening story, \u201cStone Slabs for Shaista Mahal\u201d. Sometimes, the women lash out. There\u2019s only so much you can tolerate uncomplainingly. In the final line of \u201cBlack Cobra\u201d, one of my favourites in the collection, a woman gives it back with style to her husband when he does nothing to put an end to the cruelty inflicted on a new mother by her drinking-womanising husband.\n\nIn addition to an insatiable sexual appetite, the men are also given to marry at whim and cheat their sisters and daughters of their rightful inheritance. Mushtaq reminds the reader that Islam has made ample provisions for a woman\u2019s financial security but the men have twisted the teaching of the holy book to suit their fancy. The permission to marry four times is seen by the man as a \u201cduty\u201d that he is only too happy to oblige. In his hands, it becomes a foolproof method to extract dowry, neglect the older wives, and be philandering in his ways. \u201cFire Rain\u201d and \u201cA Decision of the Heart\u201d are scathing criticisms of these practices.\n\nLocated away from the urban setups of Bengaluru, the families in these stories coexist with each other among cramped spaces and opposing mindsets. It is, therefore, not unusual for a wife to think of her husband\u2019s mother as a rival or co-sisters to be jealous of each other. \u201cA Decision of the Heart\u201d is a delightful story about a man who is determined to get his widowed mother married if only to spite his quarrelsome wife. In \u201cHigh-Heeled Shoe,\u201d a young man becomes inexplicably attracted to his sister-in-law\u2019s high-heeled shoes and desires a similar pair for his wife \u2013 never mind that she is heavily pregnant and has never worn anything besides her husband\u2019s Hawaii slippers.\n\nCome ye faithful\n\nIn \u201cSoft Whispers\u201d, a woman recalls her childhood with a local boy and their budding friendship. A clerical position at the mosque changes him as an adult \u2013 a person, who she can no longer recognise. The taste of sweet soda makes an elderly woman feel \u201cintoxicated\u201d and she becomes hooked to it \u2013 a small sliver of happiness in a long life of hardship makes for an endearing subject in \u201cA Taste of Heaven.\u201d A story that left me in splits was \u201cThe Arabic Teacher and Gobi Manchuri\u201d. A young man gives Arabic lessons to girls under the ruse of finding a wife for himself. The only condition \u2013 she must know how to cook his favourite dish, gobi manchuri. When he finally does find the woman of his dreams, she\u2019ll learn she has signed up for a lifetime of nightmares.\n\nThe spirit of the faithful is indomitable \u2013 no pain physical or emotional can crush it. When a woman is entrusted to look after 18 children during the summer vacations, she decides the only way to rein in the chaos is to have the boys circumcised. A mass event is organised where even the poor of the village can get their sons circumcised for free. A test of faith ensues when the wounds of the well-to-do boys of the woman\u2019s family get infected while a poor man\u2019s son bounces back to perfect health without any medical aid. This story, \u201cRed Lungi\u201d first appeared in The Paris Review and was my introduction to Mushtaq.\n\nIn the titular story \u201cHeart Lamp\u201d, a woman is left to her fate when her husband leaves home to bring a new wife. Their grown children or long years of togetherness mean nothing to him. Now, he is hungry for a young woman who in addition to giving him more children will, more importantly, provide him with a handsome dowry. The myriad of horrors aside, this is also a moving story about a daughter\u2019s love for her mother and the deep, unbreakable bond they share. The final scene is especially poignant.\n\nThe collection fittingly closes with \u201cBe a Woman Once, Oh Lord!\u201d. An ailing woman takes up the matter with god who seems to be blind to her sufferings. \u201cThe nib of my red ink-filled heart has broken\u201d, she says and warns him that an \u201cinexperienced potter\u201d like him need not build the world again. Her complaints are met with a rude silence.\n\nIn one story, a male character remarks, \u201cIf you who squats to pee has this much arrogance, how much arrogance should I, who stands to piss, have?\u201d A tiring amount I learnt by the end.\n\nThe strong influence of Mushtaq\u2019s work as an activist and lawyer is evident in her writing. Bhasthi writes she is a \u201cbandaya\u201d, a rebel. The men in Mushtaq\u2019s fiction are small creatures. They are overshadowed by greed, lust, and anger. An implosive cocktail. Sometimes, the best revenge, Mushtaq explains, is to let them perish in the hell of their own making.\n\nBhasthi\u2019s translator\u2019s notes illuminate her choices of doing away with italics and footnotes, and the style she adopted for translating the stories. It makes for a fascinating peek into a translator\u2019s mind. She retains the musicality of the language and the identity-related quirks of the characters. However, at times, some of the more literal translations make for small awkward bumps in an otherwise smooth ride.\n\nHeart Lamp: Selected Stories, Banu Mushtaq, translated from the Kannada by Deepa Bhasthi, Penguin India.", "summary": "Translated from the Kannada by Deepa Bhasthi, the book of 12 short stories will be published in India and the UK in April 2025.", "url": "https://scroll.in/article/1079492/heart-lamp-banu-mushtaqs-international-booker-prize-longlisted-book-is-charged-by-womens-anger", "image": "https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/205948-tlxhiofkgq-1740219153.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 02:05:00", "author": "Sayari Debnath", "authors": ["Sayari Debnath"], "language": "en", "source_country": "IN", "sentiment": 0.1}, {"id": 295492988, "title": "All Natural or All Lying?

Trump was accused of illegally retaining the documents following his first term in the White House and was indicted in June 2023 on dozens of federal felony charges.Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, eventually dismissed the documents case in July 2024, ruling that former Department of Justice (DOJ) special counsel Jack Smith had been illegally appointed by then-Attorney General Merrick Garland.Trump repeatedly claimed that the FBI raid was illegal and accused Smith, former President Joe Biden and other Democrats of unfairly targeting him in a political \"witch hunt.\"What To KnowWhite House Communications Director Steven Cheung announced in a statement on Friday that the FBI, now led by Kash Patel, was \"giving the President his property back that was taken during the unlawful and illegal raids.\"\"We are taking possession of the boxes today and loading them onto Air Force One,\" Cheung added.The president celebrated the news in a post to Truth Social, asserting that the return of the documents meant that \"justice\" was being \"restored.\"\"The Department of Justice has just returned the boxes that Deranged Jack Smith made such a big deal about,\" Trump wrote.\"Justice finally won out,\" he continued. \"I did absolutely nothing wrong.

Since being acquired by The New York Times in January 2022, the game boasts a massive following and is beloved by celebrities like Meghan Markle, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Carol Burnett, Allison Janney and more.In fact, Damon even has a Wordle group with fellow actor Bradley Cooper. During an appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show in 2023, Affleck said he wanted to join the chat, but Damon refuses to include him.\"I'm trying to get into it, and I'm being velvet-roped by the bouncer here,\" Affleck said of the Good Will Hunting star. \"He's telling me that I gotta get a cooler plus one or something.\"While speaking with Entertainment Tonight in April 2023, Burnett revealed she and Janney play Wordle too.\"We just Wordle back-and-forth,\" The Carol Burnett Show star shared at the time. \"She's the first one every morning at my coffee.\"How to Play WordlePlayers of the game must guess the daily five-letter word within six tries with the help of color-coded boxes. Green boxes indicate the letter is correct and in the right place; yellow boxes indicate the letter is in the word, though not in the correct spot; and gray boxes indicate the letter is not in the word whatsoever.In an interview with Newsweek in 2022, Wordle inventor Josh Wardle said he's \"reluctant to tell anybody how they should play\" but encourages users \"to experiment with different ideas and to find their own [starting] words, rather than just sticking to the same proven tactics over and over again.\"\"One thing I will say is that a lot of people tend to think that the game is just about finding those green and gold letters.

Realizing the signs of a minor stroke, she acknowledged this was the one that ultimately took her life. The doctor was summoned, but it was very swift.\n\nIt remains uncertain what Lady Thatcher was reading at the time of her passing, but sources suggest it might have been the newspapers from that morning.\n\nIt is believed that Lady Thatcher might have been staying in the room at a discounted rate or possibly for free, courtesy of the Barclay brothers, who own the hotel and the Daily Telegraph.\n\nHer body was collected from the hotel by a private ambulance nearly 13 hours later, at 12:20 am the following day, with her funeral set for next Wednesday.\n\nAt the time of her death, her twins Mark and Carol were overseas, but there were claims today that they had been restricting visits to their mother.\n\n\u201cThey opted to permit just one visitor per week at The Ritz, and more often than not, those visits would be canceled,\u201d reported one critic.\n\n\u201cI regret that I couldn\u2019t be there to see her. I believed I could bring her some joy. I feel robbed of a chance to say goodbye.\u201d\n\nTory MP Conor Burns, who visited her weekly, shared: \u201cWe would enjoy a couple of what she referred to as \u2018proper ones\u2019 \u2013 stiff gins \u2013 or a bottle of wine.\u201d\n\nHe noted that she sometimes preferred silence, so he brought along magazines or newspapers, and they would enjoy reciting Kipling and her beloved childhood poem, the Owl and the Pussycat.\n\nThey also engaged in political discussions, and when he told her that Nick Clegg intended to abolish the House of Lords, she retorted, \u201cWell, we should abolish the Liberal Democrats.\u201d\n\nIn her later life, she would occasionally dine at the Ritz, where staff were well aware to serve chicken consomm\u00e9 alongside a main course of lemon sole. Other patrons frequently applauded her presence as she entered the dining area.\n\nIn March of the previous year, she was spotted on a park bench in London basking in the sun with her caregiver Kate. High heels were replaced by comfy sandals, complemented by a walking stick.\n\nDuring Christmas, she underwent minor surgery in a hospital to have a growth removed from her bladder. Upon her discharge, she found herself unsteady on her feet, making a return home impractical.\n\nTherefore, she quietly relocated to a suite at the Ritz \u2013 one of her preferred destinations \u2013 and the Barclay brothers invited her to reside there for the foreseeable future.\n\nShe never departed.\n\nHer two caregivers alternated staying with her, and the same circle of friends who had previously visited her at her Belgravia residence were organized on a visit schedule at the Ritz.\n\nReportedly, ten staff members from the distinguished hotel are on the guest list for Lady Thatcher\u2019s funeral.\n\nYesterday, her body was escorted away by three undertakers.in the front, accompanied by four diplomatic protection officers on motorbikes.\n\nA BMW 4\u00d74 trailed behind, containing two men in the front and featuring blacked-out windows in the back. Security was elevated, with over a dozen police officers surrounding the hotel as the vehicle departed.\n\nA police helicopter hovered in the sky above. The ambulance made its way through the wrought iron gates at the back of the hotel, which had been under strict surveillance since the announcement of her death.\n\nPreparations were underway for the ceremonial funeral, set to occur at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral in central London with full military honors, as MPs began organizing tributes to her in Parliament.\n\nMeanwhile, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are also expected to attend the service at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, marking the first political funeral that Britain\u2019s monarch has attended personally since Winston Churchill\u2019s in 1965.\n\nLady Thatcher\u2019s family was anticipated to gather in London yesterday, with her son Mark expected to arrive from Spain last night and his twin sister Carol now believed to be in the country as well.\n\nFollowing the official funeral ceremony, a separate private family gathering will take place as Lady Thatcher is cremated in Mortlake, South West London.\n\nIt is understood that her ashes will subsequently be interred alongside her husband Sir Denis\u2019s in the cemetery at the Royal Hospital in Chelsea.\n\nThe costs associated with the funeral will be shared between the Government and Lady Thatcher\u2019s estate, which is thought to be around $15 million.\n\nThe list of international mourners is expected to be led by former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Nancy Reagan, the wife of her close ally, US President Ronald Reagan.\n\nMPs are being called back from their Easter recess today to allow them to pay tribute to her. The House of Lords has also been recalled and will convene at 2:30 PM, coinciding with the Commons.\n\nHowever, as tributes poured in for Britain\u2019s first and only female prime minister, many from the Left criticized the social repercussions of her policies that promoted the free market and diminished the power of unions.\n\nOn Monday evening, numerous individuals held gatherings in Glasgow and Brixton, south London, to \u2018celebrate\u2019 her passing. Nonetheless, today the Government will be presenting a motion expected to honor her legacy.\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron is anticipated to address the Commons, followed by Labour leader Ed Miliband. There will also be an opportunity for backbench MPs to share their personal tributes to her.\n\nAs Lady Thatcher\u2019s health declined, the question of whether she should receive a state funeral\u2014similar to Churchill\u2019s\u2014became increasingly contentious.\n\nHowever, it has come to light that she herself rejected the notion and also insisted that she did not wish for her body to lie in state or for funds to be allocated for a fly-past.\n\nInstead, the streets will be cleared for a procession from Westminster to St Paul\u2019s, where a televised service attended by dignitaries from around the globe will take place.\n\nby Vandas Voice", "summary": "This is the deathbed of Baroness Thatcher, located within The Ritz, encircled by those who cared for her.

The chiefs went and returned to tell Nkrumah that Ghana had split between the United Party and the Convention People\u2019s Party.\n\n\u201cNkrumah is a CPP man, so he should go round when he finds a CPP woman, he can name the airport or anything after her because, if Yaa Asantewaa had been alive, she would have been a UP member,\u201d he narrated.\n\nPublications by other historians indicate that Kwame Nkrumah was adamant that naming the airport after Yaa Asantewaa was the right thing to do and made moves to get the blessing of Asanteman to name the airport after her until the overthrow of his government on February 24, 1966.\n\nWho is Yaa Asantewaa\n\nYaa Asantewaa was the Queen Mother of Ejisu in the then Asante empire. She was appointed by her brother Nana Akwasi Afrane Okese, the Edwesuhene, or ruler, of Edwesu.\n\nIn 1900, she led the Ashanti war, also known as the War of the Golden Stool or the Yaa Asantewaa War of Independence, against the British Empire.", "summary": "Ghana&#8217;s first president, Dr Kwame Nkrumah Amid the ongoing discussions about the christening of Ghana\u2019s main airport after Lieutenant General Emmanuel Kwasi Kotoka, who was the brain behind the 1966 coup d&#8217;\u00e9tat that overthrew the Nkrumah government, it has emerged that Ghana\u2019s first president planned to name the airport after Yaa Asantewaa, the Asante queen [&#8230;]\n\n\nThe post The untold story of how Kwame Nkrumah almost named Kotoka International Airport after Yaa Asantewaa appeared first on Ghanamma.com.", "url": "https://www.ghanamma.com/2025/03/01/the-untold-story-of-how-kwame-nkrumah-almost-named-kotoka-international-airport-after-yaa-asantewaa/", "image": "https://cdn.ghanaweb.com/imagelib/pics/791/79144395.295.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 08:09:35", "author": "Ghana News", "authors": ["Ghana News"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "gh", "sentiment": -0.077}, {"id": 295574018, "title": "There Were Two Presidents in The Past Government \u2013 Duncan Williams Drops Revelation", "text": "Prominent Ghanaian preacher, Archbishop Nicholas Duncan Williams, has stirred debate with a bold revelation at a clergy meeting organized by President John Mahama at the Accra International Conference Center on Friday, 28th February, 2025.\n\nHis statement about an alleged \u201csecond president\u201d in the past government has left Ghanaians speculating about which administration he was referring to.\n\nSpeaking as a guest speaker at the event, Duncan Williams recounted a time when a particular government appeared to have two heads of state.

Given these documented statements, the president\u2019s claim in his 2025 SONA does not align with historical records from 2016.\n\nClaim on Cedi Depreciation\n\nIn paragraph 14, the president highlights the continued depreciation of the Ghanaian cedi, reporting a 19% loss in value against the U.S. dollar in 2024, following a 27.8% depreciation in 2023. While IERPP acknowledges that the NPP government may not have achieved all of its economic targets and that challenges remain, a broader analysis of data from the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Ghana from 2013 to 2024 reveals significant efforts in stabilizing the local currency, particularly between 2017 and 2024.\n\nDespite periods of volatility, the cumulative exchange rate depreciation showed a decline from 73.8% during the NDC administration (2009\u20132016) to 71.4% under the NPP government (2017\u20132023). This suggests that while currency depreciation remains a concern, policy measures implemented in recent years have contributed to a relatively slower rate of decline. We believe that factors such as improved fiscal discipline, monetary policy adjustments, and the gold-for-oil policy have played a role in gauging the exchange rate trajectory. However, sustaining long-term stability will require further structural reforms, increased foreign exchange reserves, and diversified economic growth strategies.\n\nClaim on the Financial Sector\n\nFurthermore, the president asserted that Ghana\u2019s financial sector continues to struggle despite the previous government\u2019s reportedly expenditure of GHS 29.9 billion on the financial sector clean-up exercise to date. However, IERPP considers this claim misleading and seeks to clarify the reality of the sector\u2019s recovery. According to the World Bank\u2019s 8th Ghana Economic Update, more than half of the 23 banks operating in Ghana are in a strong position, eliminating the need for further recapitalization. The report highlights that, within just one year, most banks successfully achieved over two-thirds of the required recapitalization target, despite the initial three-year timeline set for completion.\n\nIn addition to improved capital adequacy, Ghana\u2019s banking sector has witnessed a remarkable recovery in profitability. The return-on-equity (ROE) after tax surged from a negative -34.4% in December 2022 to a positive 34.2% in December 2023, demonstrating a strong turnaround in financial performance. Similarly, return-on-assets (ROA) improved significantly, rising from -3.8% to 5.4% over the same period.\n\nThe Institute of Economic Research and Public Policy, IERPP, believes that these indicators suggest that while challenges remain, the financial sector has made significant strides in resilience and recovery. The implementation of regulatory measures, improved asset quality, and enhanced risk management strategies have contributed to the sector\u2019s stability. Going forward, continued fiscal discipline, efficient monetary policies, and investor confidence will be crucial in ensuring sustained growth in Ghana\u2019s financial sector.\n\nClaim on Reserves\n\nThe President also stated that the previous administration left minimal reserves for debt servicing, despite implementing what he described as one of the most severe and distressing economic policies in the history of the Fourth Republic\u2014the Domestic Debt Exchange Programme. However, it remains unclear whether the President was referring specifically to Gross International Reserves (GIR).\n\nTo set the record straight, the Institute for Economic Research and Policy Perspectives (IERPP) emphasizes that, as of now, Ghana\u2019s gross international reserves stand at approximately $8.9 billion, which translates to four (4) months of import cover. This figure is among the highest reserve levels recorded under the Fourth Republic, offering a robust buffer against external economic shocks. For historical context, when His Excellency the President handed over power on January 7, 2017, the gross international reserves stood at approximately $5.78 billion (2013-2016), providing around 3.4 months of import cover.\n\nFurthermore, if the President\u2019s assertion was specifically referencing the sinking fund, IERPP\u2019s assessment indicates that, as of January 2025, the previous NPP administration had left an auction excess of over GH\u00a2700 million, which remained unspent. Additionally, an extra GH\u00a23 billion in end-of-year revenue was available as a financial cushion, supplemented by other unutilized funds across various accounts. Given these facts, the President\u2019s claim that inadequate reserves were left for debt servicing does not align with the available data and financial records.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.", "summary": "On Thursday, February 27, 2025, President John Dramani Mahama delivered his first State of the Nation Address (SONA) before the 9th Parliament, as mandated by Article 67 of the 1992 Constitution of the Republic of Ghana.

Despite hyping the release of the supposedly secret FBI documents as a bombshell, the binders Bondi delivered to Trump supporters turned out to contain very little new information about Epstein\u2019s criminal cases.\n\nInstead, the roughly 200 pages of documents mainly consisted of flight logs on Epstein\u2019s planes and some contact information of his hundreds of associates, including Donald Trump, as well as an inventory of some of the items found in the homes that the FBI raided. \n\nWhat wasn\u2019t included, though, was any fresh allegations about Epstein or any other associates, prompting the MAGA faithful to rage about the lack of new evidence while alleging a \u201dDeep State\u201d conspiracy.\n\nSensing the anger from the right, who have long used the Epstein case to fuel other conspiracy theories, Bondi instructed New York\u2019s FBI field office to turn over \u201call records, documents, audio and video recordings, and materials related to Jeffrey Epstein and his clients, regardless of how such information was obtained\u201d by Friday morning. \n\nMidway through their three-hour-long chat, Rogan cited the criminal cases against Trump as part of a Democratic-led \u201clawfare\u201d campaign to prevent him from running for office again. Musk, meanwhile, noted that Hoffman helped back columnist E. Jean Carroll\u2019s lawsuit against Trump, which found the president liable for sexual abuse and defamation.\n\n\u201cThat lawsuit was funded by Reid Hoffman, who is a major Dem donor and also an Epstein client,\u201d the DOGE chief alleged.\n\n\u201cThe plot thickens!\u201d Rogan responded. \u201cJesus Christ, it\u2019s just so blatant. It\u2019s like so obvious. The SpaceX lawsuit, the Trump stuff, it\u2019s just so obvious.\u201d \n\nWith the conspiracy-peddling podcaster setting the stage, Musk then accused Hoffman of trying to keep Trump from returning to the White House in order to prevent FBI evidence against Epstein and possibly others from being made public.\n\n\u201cKnown Epstein clients who are obviously extremely powerful \u2013 powerful politically and very wealthy \u2013 are Bill Gates, Bill Clinton and Reid Hoffman,\u201d Musk alleged. \u201cAnd some others, too.

Additionally, Musk approvingly retweeted a post that claimed the billionaire was \u201cTERRIFIED about Trump releasing the Epstein client list after all his visits to Epstein Island.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Sunday Times in December, Hoffman said Musk had made a \u201cconviction with no evidence\u201d that he had a close relationship with Epstein and partied with the disgraced financier \u2013 who committed suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial over sex crimes. \n\nHoffman added that he also had received threats of violence and had to hire security due to Musk\u2019s conspiracy theories about him.\n\nHoffman said in 2019 that he regretted helping to \u201crepair\u201d Epstein\u2019s reputation by introducing him to tech moguls in prior years while he sought donations to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He claimed that Epstein had passed MIT\u2019s \u201cvetting process\u201d at the time, adding: \u201cMy lesson is I should go do my own research.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Hoffman claimed that he \u201cwent to no Epstein parties\u201d and wasn\u2019t really familiar with the financier\u2019s sullied reputation at the time. \n\nAdding that he didn\u2019t associate with Epstein after 2015, he speculated that Musk\u2019s sordid claims about him were \u201cseeded when he invited his old friend to an MIT fundraising dinner that was also attended by Epstein in 2015.\u201d\n\n\u201cElon\u2019s defamation makes me angry and sad,\u201d he told the Times. \u201cAngry because it is an ugly assault.

Self-harm refers to a toxic behavioural pattern that may be triggered by a mental health disorder or trauma. Further, depression, anxiety and stress can sometimes lead people to harm themselves. It may also be linked to eating disorders and substance abuse.\nDespite progress, there is still much to explore about the causes of self-harm and how to prevent it in our own lives or those of others.\nSelf-Injury Awareness Day 2025: History\nThe history of Self-Injury Awareness Day goes back to the 1800s when French Psychiatrist Philippe Pinel noticed the tendencies of some of his psychiatric patients to inflict self-harm. Self harm was declared a symptom of poor mental health in the early 20th century. In 1995, the first International Conference on Self-Mutilation was organised and the first International Society for the Study of Self-Injury was established in 1997.\nSelf-Injury Awareness Day 2025: Significance\nSelf-Injury Awareness Day aims to increase public awareness of self-harm and to debunk myths and biases around it. People who are aware of the issue may have a better understanding of dealing with self-harm.\nIt calls for people and institutions to recognise tendencies of self-harm around them and promote professional help wherever needed. The goal of this day is to reduce fear and the amount of people who suffer in silence or feel alone.\nAccording to a survey by the Mental Health Foundation, many young people tend to indulge in self-harm by giving in to the pressure of achieving perfection. Let\u2019s find out some useful tips to avoid self-harm.\nSelf-Injury Awareness Day 2025: Tips To Avoid Self-Harm\nAllow yourself to cry or sleep\nCrying releases endorphins and oxytocin, which are natural stress relievers that can elevate your mood, reduce discomfort, and encourage relaxation. Hence it\u2019s considered healthy in maintaining emotions. Further, sleep has a positive impact on the brain function and restores energy levels.\nTalk about your emotions\nMany try to control their emotions and don\u2019t talk about it. However, admitting your emotions can help in the long run. Talk to your friend, family or anyone else about how you have been feeling lately. If you feel like harming yourself, then instead of hiding it, confront it with someone.\nWrite or draw on paper\nSometimes people feel irritated with small things or issues and find it hard to express their feelings. Here, writing about emotions can help you feel calm and relaxed. Instead of taking any wrong step in the heat of a moment, you should note down your feelings.\nSeek professional help\nMental health professionals can help people identify and treat trauma and anxiety or other conditions. They can offer support, advice, and a safe space to talk.\nIf you know someone who is suffering from feelings of self-harm, you can offer support by empathetic listening and encouraging expert help.", "summary": "Self-Injury Awareness Day 2025: Self-harm refers to a toxic behavioural pattern that may be triggered by a mental health disorder or trauma.", "url": "https://www.news18.com/lifestyle/self-injury-awareness-day-2025-history-significance-and-tips-to-reduce-self-injurious-behaviour-9244241.html", "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/02/Self-Injury-Awareness-Day-2025-2025-02-4fdd79e9ee71abb12ddfc9b2c2081d9b.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 01:45:53", "author": "News18,Nibandh Vinod", "authors": ["News18", "Nibandh Vinod"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.238}, {"id": 295570344, "title": "Man City vs Plymouth: FA Cup prediction, kick-off time, team news, TV, live stream, h2h results, odds", "text": "Manchester City take on Championship strugglers Plymouth this evening in the FA Cup fifth round.\n\nMan City returned to winning ways on Wednesday night, following losses to Real Madrid and Liverpool, by beating Tottenham thanks to Erling Haaland's first-half goal.\n\nThat result has seen City move back into fourth place in the Premier League table, thus boosting their chances of qualifying for the Champions League next season.\n\nFacing a relegation-threatened Championship side means Man City will have to guard against complacency when they welcome Plymouth to the Etihad Stadium, especially as Argyle have already knocked out two Premier League sides.\n\nIn fact, Plymouth caused an almighty shock against Liverpool in round four and have nothing to lose when they visit the home of the reigning champions of England.\n\nMan City vs Plymouth is scheduled for a 5.45pm GMT kick-off tonight, Saturday, March 1, 2025.\n\nThe match will take place at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nTV channel: In the UK, the game will be televised live on ITV4.

But the recent release of updated Environment Agency maps, which included climate projections, show just how severe the situation is becoming. By the middle of this century a shocking one in four properties in England could be at risk of flooding. Between 2040 and 2060, up to 6.1 million properties could be affected by surface water flooding, and 3.1 million homes will be vulnerable to river and coastal flooding, with many experiencing water depths exceeding 30cm.

Coastal erosion: no safety net For people living by the coast, many of whom are retirees, life has become a living nightmare as rising sea levels threaten thousands of properties and the ground below communities literally erodes, and homes tumble into the sea. Unlike flood damage, which has some insurance coverage, homeowners facing coastal erosion have no financial safety net. The national coastal erosion risk map (NCERM) estimates that 5,200 properties will be lost to the sea by 2055, increasing to 19,700 by 2105.

But given the UK\u2019s current economic limitations, it\u2019s unlikely that all protective measures will be funded. And if SMPs are not put in place, the number of homes at risk could increase nine-fold. There are an increasing number of UK climate refugees \u2013 residents forced to abandon their homes because of natural disasters and environmental changes. Flooding and extreme weather events are no longer rare occurrences but are increasing realities. With all these problems bearing down on us, it\u2019s vital that developers, planners and surveyors \u2013 whose job it is to value land and buildings and provide expert advice on construction \u2013 include climate considerations to future proof properties. Relying on outdated information results in financial losses, uninsurable homes, and unfortunately even loss of life. But there are measures to limit future harm during retrofits or new build. Solutions for the future Buildings account for 39 per cent of global energy-related carbon emissions, and the construction sector is one of the most wasteful, typically reusing just one per cent of demolition materials. Using sustainable building methods is vital and integrating features like green roofs, elevated floors, and proper flood-ready drainage will become more important. Low-carbon construction, promote resilient building materials, and advocate for climate-conscious planning. The UK experienced record-breaking heat in 2024, with temperatures reaching over 40\u00b0C. Traditional cooling methods like air conditioning are energy intensive. Instead, shading, and passive cooling can keep homes comfortable and reduce energy use and therefore electricity bills.

Wildfires, which were once rare in the UK, have increased dramatically, with 24,000 recorded in 2022 \u2013 four times the previous year\u2019s figure \u2013 so fire safety in building design is crucial. The built environment needs to adapt swiftly, and sound advice is vital in driving this by incorporating strategies into every aspect of building design and construction to keep people safe for the extreme weather events that are becoming more common.

Green Swap Instead of factory-baked bread wrapped in unrecyclable plastic, buy loaves that are freshly baked in the supermarket, and carry them home in a tote bag. You\u2019ll be eating delicious bread and reducing your carbon footprint too. How people can help to green their communities Reducing the carbon footprint of your neighbourhood is much easier when everyone works together. With teamwork, we can all make the communities where we live healthier and more sustainable places \u2013 now, and for future generations. The key is getting a core group of people involved to start with. It might take a bit of organisation to get the ball rolling, but you could start a local social media group, a WhatsApp group, or hold a meeting to brainstorm ideas with your neighbours. The more people who get involved, the more of an impact on your community you can make. Spruce up your home with plants One of the easiest ways to make your community greener is by encouraging everyone to plant plants and flowers in their homes. Whether it\u2019s a front or back garden, a balcony, or even just a window box, adding some greenery can make a big difference to the ecological diversity of the area. Planting some bee-friendly flowers or growing herbs to share with your neighbours is a start, and potted plants on doorsteps can help brighten up the street. Start a community garden If you live in an area that\u2019s short on open space, a community garden is a great way to bring neighbours together to improve local biodiversity. Team up with some other residents to turn an unused plot of land into a shared garden which will provide fresh fruit, veg or flowers. Group gardening is a lot of fun and it\u2019s a great way to meet new people. Plant some trees Trees improve air quality, provide shade in summer and help fight climate change. Join your local council or an environmental group like the Woodland Trust to organise a tree-planting event in your area. Schools, parks, and disused land are all great places to add more greenery and improve the local environment. Leave the car at home Encouraging your neighbours to walk, cycle, or take public transport instead of driving helps to cut down on local pollution and traffic congestion. Try setting up a local car-sharing scheme or organising a walk to school day for families in the area. Not only does this help the environment, but it\u2019s also a great way to build stronger ties with your neighbours. Recycle and reduce waste together Recycling is great but reducing waste is even better. Try setting up a neighbourhood swap shop for books, toys, clothes and household items. You can combine it with a community picnic in your local park, or set up a social media page where residents can advertise their swaps.

There's an AMOLED screen on the back which gives you notifications and access to some of the basic functions. \n\nIt comes with Android 14 pre-loaded, running off an 8-core chip with 32gb of DDR ram, and 256gb of storage. \n\nThe camera setup is also impressive. There's a 100mp main camera, a 20mp night-vision mode, it shoots 4K video, and uses AI technology to enhance pictures. \n\nIt supports 5G and WiFi 6, 33w fast charging, and we haven't even got to the best bits yet.\n\nDoogee's USP is phones that can stand up to abuse. And the S200 is built for rough treatment. \n\nIts casing is made from aerospace-grade aluminium which meets military spec MIL-STD-810H certification and there are IP69 and IP69K protection levels from water, humidity, dust and sand.\n\nAnd, let me remind you, this phone can be bought for just \u00a3259.99. Sim free. \n\nTo put that into perspective, the Google Pixel Pro XL is \u00a31,099 at the moment, and the iPhone 16 Pro is \u00a3999. \n\nReality check time, though. It will not outperform a flagship smartphone. The hardware may be impressive on paper, but in use it just isn't as polished. \n\nThe camera, for example is pretty good on the Doogee S200, but a Pixel, iPhone, or Samsung would run rings around it, especially on video performance. \n\nWhile the display is nice and fluid and crisp, a Samsung S25 would put it to shame. \n\nAnd its processor is capable of handling some very strenuous tasks, but you can overwork it with some resource-hungry apps and games that a true flagship would handle. \n\nBut we need to put things into perspective. This isn't a stylish trinket for people who want the latest and best smartphone tech on the market. I'm blown away by how well it performs, but it's a tool, built for people who need a tool. \n\nIt's designed for the sorts of people who'll find the onboard \"ToolBag\" menu useful. Does your iPhone have a \"plumb bob\", for example? No.\n\nLove magazines but hate the cost? With Readly, you can access dozens of top tech titles for one low price \u2013 and right now, you can get two months free. Click here for more information.\n\nDoes your Pixel have a protractor or a \"gradienter\"? I don't know what that is, but I know mine doesn't. \n\nThe Doogee S200's one-click shortcuts even have an option to start the underwater camera - that's how practical and robust this thing its. \n\nIt is, however, unashamedly bulky. It feels like a conventional smartphone in an extremely hefty case. But it's heavier. If you're used to an iPhone XS, it'll shock you. \n\nI found the built-in speakers a bit tinny, and I wish it had wireless charging but its futuristic, almost sci-fi design is so appropriate for its USP, and it'll be the perfect companion for people who work on dirty building sites for a living. \n\nIf you like a dainty little phone that you can slip in a pocket or a bag, look away now. This isn't for you.\n\nBut if you like the great outdoors, if you work in an environment that kills phones quickly, or even if you\u2019re just especially clumsy, this is perfect. \n\nAnd I'm sorry to keep going on about this, but it really is an absolute bargain.", "summary": "The Doogee S200 is tough enough to meet military test standards - consumer technology writer Gareth Butterfield gives his verdict", "url": "https://www.thesouthernreporter.co.uk/recommended/this-rugged-dual-screen-smartphone-is-an-amazing-price-right-now-weve-tested-it-5010774", "image": "https://www.thesouthernreporter.co.uk/jpim-static/image/2025/02/27/15/49/DSC00642.jpeg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75&crop=3:2,smart&trim=", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 08:00:31", "author": "Gareth Butterfield", "authors": ["Gareth Butterfield"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.237}, {"id": 295567924, "title": "BGT 2025: what time is it on TV tonight?

In a speech that caught everyone by surprise, the Cameroonian football icon extended an olive branch to his supervising minister, Narcisse Mouelle Kombi, signaling a potential end to months of friction between them.\n\"It is true that we have seen certain situations from opposite angles. Your Excellency Mr. Minister, the president of one of your federations that I am, thanks you.\"\nThese words carried a weight of reconciliation, hinting at a possible truce after prolonged tensions that had cast a shadow over Cameroonian football governance.

He pointed out that India is manufacturing everything from semiconductors to aircraft carriers and that the world wants to learn about India's success in detail and expressed that this is a significant opportunity for NewsX World.\n\nHighlighting that a few months ago, India conducted the world's largest election, Shri Modi said that for the first time in 60 years, a Government in India has returned to power for the third consecutive term. He emphasized that this public trust is based on India's numerous achievements over the past 11 years. He expressed confidence that the new channel will bring India's real stories to the world without any bias, showcasing the country as it truly is.\n\n\u201cFew years ago, I had presented the vision of 'Vocal for Local' and 'Local for Global' to the nation and today, we are seeing this vision turn into reality\u201d, exclaimed the Prime Minister. He emphasized that India's AYUSH products and yoga have gone from local to global and noted that India's superfood, makhana, is also gaining global recognition, along with millets, referred to as \"Shri Anna.\" He mentioned that his friend, Tony Abbott, the former PM of Australia experienced Indian millets first hand at Delhi Haat and enjoyed the millet dishes, which pleased him.\n\nStressing that not only millets but also India's turmeric has gone from local to global, with India supplying over 60 percent of the world's turmeric, Shri Modi remarked that India's coffee has also achieved global recognition, making India the seventh-largest coffee exporter in the world. He emphasized that India's mobile phones, electronic products, and medicines are gaining global recognition. He noted that India is leading several global initiatives. Mentioning the recent opportunity to attend the AI Action Summit in France, where India was the co-host and will now take on the responsibility of hosting it, the Prime Minister highlighted India's successful G-20 summit during its presidency, where the India-Middle East-Europe Corridor was introduced as a new economic route. He mentioned that India has given a strong voice to the Global South and prioritized the interests of island nations. To address the climate crisis, India has presented the Mission LiFE vision to the world, he added. Shri Modi also mentioned India's leadership in initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. He expressed his happiness that as many Indian brands are going global, India's media is also understanding and embracing this global opportunity.\n\nRemarking that for decades, the world referred to India as its back office, the Prime Minister said, \u201ctoday, India is becoming the new factory of the world\u201d. He emphasized that India is not just a workforce but a world-force and highlighted that the country, which once imported many products, is now emerging as an export hub. He noted that farmers, who were once limited to local markets, are now reaching global markets with their produce. Shri Modi mentioned the increasing global demand for Pulwama's snow peas, Maharashtra's Purandar figs, and Kashmir's cricket bats. He emphasized that India's defense products showcase the strength of Indian engineering and technology to the world. He pointed out that from electronics to the automobile sector, the world has witnessed India's scale and capability. \u201cIndia is not only providing products to the world but is also becoming a trusted and reliable partner in the global supply chain\u201d, he added.\n\n\u201cIndia's leadership in various sectors is the result of years of hard work and systematic policy decisions\u201d, said Shri Modi and highlighted the progress made over the past ten years, where incomplete bridges and stalled roads have now transformed into dreams moving forward at a new pace with good roads and excellent expressways. He emphasized that reduced travel time and costs have provided the industry with an opportunity to decrease logistics turnaround time, benefiting the automobile sector significantly. He noted the increased demand for vehicles and the encouragement of EV production, adding that today, India has emerged as a major automobile producer and exporter.\n\nPrime Minister remarked that a similar transformation has been observed in electronics manufacturing. Over the past decade, electricity has reached more than 2.5 crore families for the first time, leading to increased demand and production of electronic equipment, he added. He highlighted that affordable data has boosted the demand for mobile phones, and the increased availability of services on mobile phones has led to higher consumption of digital devices. He mentioned that programs like PLI Schemes have turned this demand into an opportunity, making India a major electronics exporter. Emphasising that India's ability to set and achieve large targets is rooted in the mantra of \"Minimum Government, Maximum Governance,\" which promotes efficient and effective governance without Government interference or pressure, Shri Modi provided an example of how the Government had abolished around 1,500 obsolete laws over the past decade, many of which were enacted during British rule. One such law was the Dramatic Performance Act, which allowed the arrest of people dancing in public places. This law was in effect for 70 years after independence and was abolished by the current Government. The Prime Minister also mentioned the example of bamboo, which is the lifeline of tribal areas and the North East. Previously, cutting bamboo could lead to arrest, as it was classified as a tree. The Government has now changed this decades-old law, recognizing bamboo as grass. He remarked at the silence of previous leaders and the Lutyens' elite on such outdated laws and emphasized the current Government's efforts to remove them.\n\nMentioning that ten years ago, filing an ITR was a difficult task for an ordinary person but today, it can be done in a few moments, and refunds are credited to accounts within days, the Prime Minister highlighted that the process of simplifying income tax laws is ongoing in Parliament. He added that income up to \u20b912 lakh has been made tax-free, benefiting the salaried class significantly and emphasized that the budget has helped young professionals fulfill their aspirations and increase their savings. Shri Modi stated that the goal is to provide ease of living, ease of doing business, and open skies for the country's people and their aspirations. He noted that many startups are benefiting from geospatial data, which previously required government permission to create maps. The government has changed this, allowing startups and private companies to make excellent use of this data, he added. \n\nHighlighting that India, the land that gave the world the concept of zero, is now becoming the land of infinite innovations, the Prime Minister stressed that India was not only innovating but also \"Indovating,\" meaning innovating the Indian way. He highlighted that India is creating solutions that are affordable, accessible, and adaptable, and offering these solutions to the world without gatekeeping. He mentioned that when the world needed a secure and cost-effective digital payment system, India developed the UPI (Unified Payments Interface) system. Shri Modi said that Professor Carlos Montes was impressed by the people-friendly nature of UPI technology and mentioned that today, countries like France, UAE, and Singapore are integrating UPI into their financial ecosystems. He also mentioned that many countries are signing agreements to connect with India's digital public infrastructure, India Stack. During the COVID-19 pandemic, India's vaccine demonstrated the country's quality healthcare solutions to the world. The Prime Minister highlighted that the Aarogya Setu app was made open source to benefit the world. He emphasized that India is a major space power and is helping other countries achieve their space aspirations. He stated that India is working on AI for public good and sharing its experience and expertise with the world.\n\nLauding the ITV Network for launching numerous fellowships today, Shri Modi emphasized that the youth of India are the biggest beneficiaries and stakeholders of a developed India, making them a top priority. He highlighted that the National Education Policy has provided children with the opportunity to think beyond textbooks. He added that from middle school, children are learning coding and preparing for fields like AI and data science. Talking about the Atal Tinkering Labs, which are giving children hands-on experience with emerging technologies. He said this year's budget has announced the creation of 50,000 new Atal Tinkering Labs.\n\nShri Modi remarked that in the world of news, various agencies' subscriptions help in better news coverage. Similarly, students in the field of research need access to as many information sources as possible. He added that previously, they had to subscribe to different journals at high costs but the Government had relieved researchers of this concern by introducing the \"One Nation, One Subscription\" initiative, ensuring free access to renowned journals worldwide for every researcher in the country. The government is set to spend over \u20b96,000 crore on this initiative, he said. Emphasising that the Government was ensuring the best research facilities for every student, whether in space exploration, biotech research, or AI, the Prime Minister highlighted that India's children are emerging as future leaders. Mentioning about the remarkable experiences of Dr. Brian Greene\u2019s meeting with IIT students, and astronaut Mike Massimino\u2019s meeting with Central School students, the Prime Minister expressed confidence that a significant future innovation will come from a small school in India.\n\nEmphasizing that India's aspiration and direction are to see its flag waving on every global platform, the Prime Minister remarked that this is not the time for small thinking or small steps. He expressed happiness that as a media institution, NewsX World has understood this sentiment. He highlighted that ten years ago, the focus was on reaching different states within the country, but today, the network has taken the bold step of going global. Shri Modi stated that this inspiration and resolve should be present in every citizen and entrepreneur. He shared his vision of seeing an Indian brand in every market, drawing room, and dining table worldwide. He emphasized that \"Made in India\" should become the world's mantra. The Prime Minister expressed his dream that people think of \"Heal in India\" when they are ill, \"Wed in India\" when they plan a wedding, and prioritize India for travel, conferences, exhibitions, and concerts. He highlighted the importance of fostering this positive attitude and strength within ourselves and acknowledged the significant role of the network and channel in this endeavor. He stated that the possibilities are endless, and it is now up to us to turn them into reality with courage and determination.\n\n\u201cIndia is moving forward with the resolve to become a developed nation in the next 25 years\u201d, emphasised Shri Modi and concluded by encouraging the ITV network to take a similar resolve to establish itself on the world stage, expressing confidence in their success.\n\nThe Founder of ITV Media Network and Rajya Sabha MP, Shri Karthikeya Sharma, Former Prime Minister of Australia, H.E.

Addressing the gathering, he extended his heartfelt congratulations on the auspicious launch of NewsX World. He highlighted that the network includes channels in Hindi, English, and various regional languages, and today, it is going global. He also remarked on the initiation of several fellowships and scholarships, extending his best wishes for these programs.\n\nRemarking that he had attended similar media events in the past, but NewsX World had set a new trend today, Shri Modi extended special congratulations for this achievement. He highlighted that media events of this nature are a tradition in the country, but NewsX World has given it a new dimension. He added that their summit focused on discussion of policies and was policy-centric as compared to politics-centric. He added that this summit had given great importance to discussions and deliberations by many dignitaries from across various fields. He acknowledged that they have worked on an innovative model, and expressed hope that other media houses will enrich this trend and template in their own innovative ways.\n\n\u201cThe world is keenly watching 21st-century India\u201d, exclaimed the Prime Minister. He said that people from around the globe want to visit and understand India. He emphasized that India is a country where positive news is being created, new records are being set daily, and something new is happening every day.

The pain can occur in the upper, middle or lower back. It is pain in the lower back though which is the most common, given that the lumbar spine supports most of the body weight.\nMen and women alike suffer from it and the reasons could range from defective posture, overwork, mental stress, to spinal changes, and so on. Treatment usually includes medication and lifestyle changes, physiotherapy, Yoga and other therapies.\nYOGA HAS A CURE\nYoga is particularly useful because it provides sustained relief by addressing underlying causes through gentle stretching, correcting the posture, reducing weight, teaching how to distribute energy correctly and, most importantly, teaching one to relax.\nOne of the most respected names in Yoga therapy, Dr R Nagarathna, Medical Director of Arogyadhama Holistic Health Centre, Bengaluru, is also a medical doctor specialising in internal medicine. She has been treating patients for over five decades, combining both conventional medicine and Yoga.\nSpeaking recently at a national seminar on \u2018Yoga Research and Evidence-Based Yoga Therapy\u2019 at Bengaluru\u2019s SVYASA University, she suggested four poses for dealing with lower back pain. She revealed that these stretches provide relief at the physical and energy levels. However, the real gains or cure occur when the patient is able to take the Asanas to the level described by Patanjali in his Yoga Sutra.\nHow This Patient Got Rid of His Back Pain: Dr Nagarathna cited the case of a patient from Punjab who seemed to have taken her words very seriously, applying Patanjali\u2019s sutras in his practice after he returned home. Reportedly, instead of using his Yoga practice-hour to do the 15 asanas he had learnt at the Yoga centre, he focussed on four specific poses for the back, utilising 45 minutes to only perform those.\nAfter achieving stability in the pose, he would focus his mind on the painful area, then diffuse the pain by letting his mind spread throughout his body, and finally move it out of the body. Through these efforts, within a few weeks he was able to reach that state of relaxation and rid himself of his chronic back issue.\nWHAT DOES PATANJALI SAY?\nThe two relevant sutras to be applied are:\nSthira-sukham-asanam\nPrayatna-saithilya-ananta-samapatti-bhyam\nThe first sutra is about the state when the pose becomes stable and comfortable. The second talks about how to get there, by letting go of effort and exertion and instead just relaxing the body \u2014 then moving one\u2019s awareness to the vast sky and infiniteness.\n\u201cYou must somehow get your patients to touch that \u2018ananta samapatti\u2019 that Patanjali talks about. That connects them to their inner being and that\u2019s when the healing happens,\u201d said Dr Nagarathna, addressing the gathering of Yoga therapists and scholars.\nGiven below are the four specific poses for lower back pain. In an interview, Dr Nagarathna told me how to get the most out of these. \n\u201cMaintaining the final position, focus the mind on the lumbar spine for about one minute; relax that point of stretch (prayatna shaithilya). This gives the \u2018sthira\u2019 state. Continue to stay in the posture while you start imagining that you are spreading the awareness from this point to the whole body; now get out of the body awareness to expand into the space in the whole room and beyond to reach the beautiful, vast blue sky above. The body continues to remain in the same position. Enjoy the \u2018let go\u2019 experience. This is \u2018ananta samapatti\u2019 to reach \u2018sukha\u2019 in the final posture. This is the healer within,\u201d she said. \nPAVANMUKTASANA LUMBAR STRETCH\nLie on the back, feet together, hands resting beside the body.\nExhaling, bend and draw the right knee towards the chest and clasp with both the hands. Wrap the arms just below the knee and firmly press the knee against the chest.\nMaintain this pose with normal breathing.\nInhaling, release the clasped hands, straighten the leg and return to the starting position.\nRepeat with the left leg to complete one round. Do three rounds each.\nNext, do three rounds with both legs lifted together. This time, bend both the knees and clasp with both arms while exhaling; release while inhaling.\nCheckpoints: a) Do not lift the head and the spine off the mat; b) In steps 1 to 6 ensure the other leg remains straight on the floor as you lift and fold the other.\nFOLDED-LEG LUMBAR STRETCH\nLie down on your back; with knees pointing up and soles of the feet on the floor. Place your palms under the head.\n\nExhaling, drop both legs to the right side \u2013 knee upon knee \u2013 till they touch the floor. Simultaneously, move the head and neck in the opposite direction.\nInhaling come back to the centre. Next, exhaling, drop the legs to the left side, turning the head and neck to the right.\nReturn to the starting position, inhaling.\nThis is one round. Do five rounds.\nCheckpoints: a) There should be no force felt on the back; b) Don\u2019t force the knees to remain together when they touch the ground.\nCROSS-LEG LUMBAR STRETCH\nLie on your back and spread your arms out so the body looks like the letter T.\nFold both legs: knees point up and feet are flat on the ground. Cross the left knee over the right. Inhale.\nExhaling, gently move the crossed legs together to the left to touch the ground; press down. Simultaneously, turn your head in the opposite direction. Stay there with normal breathing.\nInhaling, return to the centre.\nRepeat with the right leg crossed over the left and bend towards the right side this time.\nThis completes one round. Do five rounds.\nCheckpoints: a) When moving the head in the opposite direction, a mild stretch should be felt on the back; b) Don\u2019t overexert when pressing the knees to the ground to avoid getting a catch in the back.\nSETUBANDHASANA OR BRIDGE POSE\nLie on your back, bend the knees, lay feet flat on the ground with one-foot distance between them.\nKeep your heels close to the buttocks, place arms on the sides of the body with palms facing down.\nInhaling, lift up the pelvis and then the trunk as much as you can comfortably.\nExhaling, return to the starting position. Relax.\nRepeat five times.\nCheckpoints: Ensure there is no tension in the shoulders or the neck in the final position.\nNote: These poses are indicative. Each case is different; please check with your Physician before attempting any new exercise regimen, know your limitations, and never exceed your capacity.\nThe author is a journalist, cancer survivor and certified yoga teacher.

It was a 2019 phone call that eventually sparked an impeachment.On Friday, a meeting in the Oval Office that started out with cordialities turned heated at the end, with Vice President JD Vance telling Zelenskyy to show more gratitude toward Trump, before the president himself began shouting.\u201cYou're gambling with the lives of millions of people,\" Trump berated Zelenskyy. \"You're gambling with World War III.\u201d With that, Trump scrapped plans to sign an agreement that would have allowed the US to access Ukraine's rare earth minerals, a deal the US president had said would have helped move the war toward a conclusion. The blowup cast new doubt on the future of US support for Kyiv in fending off Russia's invasion.Also Read: Make A Deal or US Is Out: Trump-Zelenskyy-Vance In Full Blown Public Spat, White House Shares Full VideoA look at the evolution of Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship over the years: 'Perfect' phone call In July 2019, Zelenskyy was anxious for a meeting with Trump at the White House, one of the Ukrainian leader's top foreign policy priorities at the time.During a 30-minute call, Trump dangled the possibility of a face-to-face meeting. But he also suggested that future US military support for Ukraine might be contingent on its leader helping investigate business dealings there by Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son.The elder Biden was competing for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Trump seemed to want to weaken him 15 months out from Election Day.Trump denied wrongdoing and began referring to his exchange with Zelenskyy as a \u201cperfect\" phone call. Even Zelenskyy later insisted that he faced \u201cno blackmail\u201d.But Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House in December 2019 on abuse of power and obstruction of justice charges, only the third American commander in chief to be in that situation. He was acquitted by the Senate.Russia's war in Ukraine Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb 24, 2022, triggering the biggest conflict on the European continent since World War II.Since then, the US has provided more than $65 billion in military assistance to Ukraine. The Biden administration made steadfast military and political support for Zelenskyy's country a centrepiece of his foreign policy.As the war raged, the Biden White House staunchly defended continuing to provide support to Ukraine, even as some Republicans began grumbling about so much funding for a war that had no end in sight.In a speech to Congress in December 2022, Zelenskyy thanked \"every American\" for supporting his country.\u201cYour money is not charity,\u201d he said then. \"It's an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.\u201d Trump, then campaigning for his second term, said repeatedly that Russia would never have invaded Ukraine if he'd been president and that he'd have no trouble solving the conflict.Upon taking office, he upended years of US policy by dispatching negotiators to Saudi Arabia to meet with officials from Russian President Vladimir Putin's government, and also began hammering out the minerals deal that he and Zelenskyy had planned to sign Friday.Trump meets with Zelenskyy ahead of Election Day 2024 Last September, Zelenskyy accompanied Biden to a Pennsylvania ammunition factory to thank the workers producing some of the most critically needed munitions for his country's fight with Russian ground forces.A few days later, he travelled to Trump Tower in Manhattan and discussed ending the war. In comments to Fox News Channel afterward, Trump said of the fighting, \u201cIt should stop and the president wants it to stop,\" meaning Zelenskyy.\u201cAnd I'm sure President Putin wants it to stop and that's a good combination,\u201d Trump added. Zelenskyy invited Trump to visit Ukraine, to which Trump responded, \"I will.\" That trip came up again Friday, when Vance told Zelenskyy, \u201cYou went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition.\" Zelenskyy's September trip was not billed as political, though, and Trump's election opponent was Vice President Kamala Harris, not Biden. Still, Pennsylvania is a battleground state and some congressional Republicans at the time accused Democrats of using Zelenskyy's visit to bolster Harris politically.Trump calls Zelenskyy a dictator, then suggests he didn't Last December, Trump met with Zelenskyy again during a visit to Paris to attend the reopening of the Notre Dame cathedral. It was a hastily arranged three-way meeting set up by French President Emmanuel Macron, who was trying to push the president-elect to maintain support for Ukraine in its defence against Russia's invasion.As president, Trump has publicly prodded Zelenskyy that he had better move quickly to negotiate an end to Russia's war in Ukraine, or risk no longer having a country to lead. On his social media site, Trump decried Zelenskyy for not organising an election to decide if he should remain in power \u2014 an idea backed by Russia \u2014 calling him a \u201cdictator without elections\u201d.He also suggested that Ukraine was responsible for Russia's invasion, but later conceded that Russia was the aggressor.Before this week, Zelenskyy had been to the White House four times \u2014 all during the Biden administration. When the Ukrainian leader announced he was coming to Washington and was ready to sign a minerals deal, Trump's tone got more conciliatory.He called America's support for Ukraine against Russia's invasion \u201ca very worthy thing to do.\u201d And, when pressed about having called Zelenskyy a dictator, Trump responded: \u201cDid I say that? I can't believe I said that. Next question.\" It all served to make Friday's blowup all the more spectacular.

While it fosters empathy for the less fortunate, Ramadan is also a celebration of food, with Malaysia\u2019s bustling bazaars offering a wide array of dishes for breaking fast as evening settles.\nIn Kuala Lumpur, securing a spot at these bazaars is highly competitive, as a month\u2019s sales can rival a year\u2019s earnings elsewhere, according to traders. Licences, issued by city hall to hawker associations for as little as 300 ringgit (US$67), were often resold at inflated prices \u2013 sometimes reaching 20,000 ringgit.\nThese costs trickled down to customers, driving up prices and discouraging many from patronising the bazaars.\nFederal Territories Minister Zaliha Mustafa, whose authority supersedes city hall, disrupted this system by cutting out middlemen and auctioning licences directly to \u201cthose who are genuinely keen to trade\u201d. On Wednesday, she warned that anyone caught reselling their licence would lose it.\n\u201cWe will take stern action against both the seller and the buyer,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will rescind the licence and blacklist them.\u201d\nUnder the new rules, licence holders must be present at their stalls or risk closure. The auction process is also now live-streamed on city hall\u2019s Facebook page for transparency.\n\nTraders have welcomed the reform after years of navigating an opaque and expensive process dominated by proxies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so much better than having to pay 10,000 ringgit for a spot last year,\u201d said Kuala Lumpur trader Sopian Aris.\nSopian, who usually sells local delicacies by the roadside, said the Ramadan bazaar was crucial, as sales were limited to evenings throughout the month.\n\u201cIn other months, I can sell in the morning, move to another place for the lunch crowd, and set up at a night market,\u201d he said.\nAs part of Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim\u2019s push to reduce Malaysia\u2019s reliance on foreign labour, Zaliha also instructed traders not to hire foreign workers, regardless of their legal status.\nThe public meanwhile hopes that these changes will put an end to the empty \u201cair-filled curry puffs\u201d that have been the running joke in the country as traders skimp on ingredients to cut costs.\n\u201cWe are all tired from fasting, the last thing we want at the end of the day is to feel cheated,\u201d Facebook User Elly Murad said.\n\u201cReflect on the meaning of the holy month, and do better\u201d.", "summary": "Licences to operate stalls at food bazaars are now auctioned directly to those \u2018genuinely keen to trade\u2019, thereby cutting out middlemen.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3300616/ramadan-price-gougers-put-notice-malaysia-holy-month-looms", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/02/28/8d7fdf65-5988-44fc-a790-b5843eaba4e7_4073ef40.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 04:00:19", "author": "Hadi Azmi", "authors": ["Hadi Azmi"], "language": "en", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": 0.229}, {"id": 295509512, "title": "China\u2019s Tiantuo satellite breakthrough enables global cargo surveillance: PLA scientists", "text": "Satellite technology that can track hundreds of millions of shipping containers around the world has been successfully tested by Chinese military scientists, in a huge leap forward in monitoring global supply chains.\nDeveloped by researchers with the National University of Defence Technology (NUDT) in Changsha, the technology centres on the Tiantuo-5 satellite \u2013 a compact, 80kg (175lb) orbiter launched in 2020.\nRecent trials have proved that China can gather real-time data from Internet of Things (IoT) sensors on cargo containers, including their location, internal conditions and even tamper alerts, according to a paper published last month in the peer-reviewed Journal of NUDT.\nThe breakthrough will help Beijing enforce export controls \u2013 just as China tightens restrictions on exports of advanced technologies, such as aerospace engine and military drone components, to the United States and its allies.\nThe researchers said the satellite network could become a cornerstone of Beijing\u2019s strategy to curb smuggling \u2013 for example shipments of restricted goods through third countries \u2013 while amassing unprecedented visibility into global trade flows.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about catching smugglers,\u201d said a Beijing-based logistics expert who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about building a system to enforce our own rules \u2013 and break the chains that have been imposed on developing countries for over a century \u2013 with a technology revolution in space,\u201d he said. He noted that Tiantuo means \u201cbreaking new ground with the power of heaven\u201d.\nThe system relies on a planned constellation of 66 low-cost nanosatellites, each smaller than a refrigerator, according to the team led by Li Songting and Chen Lihu, associate professors at NUDT\u2019s college of aerospace science and engineering.\n\nOne of its main innovations is a hybrid network that separates slower \u201cstatic\u201d sensors, such as containers in port, from fast-moving cargo using distinct signal protocols, preventing data collisions.\nThe researchers have brought military-grade efficiency into the project, borrowing techniques from China\u2019s missile-tracking systems to process 10 times more data streams than commercial satellites such as Iridium.\nSensors can detect when a container is opened mid-journey or exposed to abnormal temperatures \u2013 red flags for illicit transfers.\nIn one trial, the satellite picked up and analysed over 1 million messages emitted from ships across the globe in a day, the NUDT paper claimed.\nThe technology will also assist China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, integrating infrastructure projects with data control, according to Li and Chen. It could help countries fight some serious and common security threats, such as pirates and the drug trade.\nBut while the PLA researchers insist the system is for peaceful purposes, some US officials and politicians are already nervous. The US government has recently banned the use of Chinese equipment such as cranes in their ports, worrying that these machines can collect and transmit data back to China.\nIf China deployed the full 66-satellite constellation as planned using its Long March rocket fleet, it would mark the first time a nation had operated an IoT network capable of surveilling hundreds of millions of endpoints \u2013 a scale that even US systems did not currently match, according to the NUDT team.\nThe American Orbcomm system, already in service, can only connect to 10 million devices while SpaceX\u2019s Starlink is optimised for high-speed internet connection instead of industrial data transmission, the researchers said.", "summary": "Technology to track hundreds of millions of shipping containers has been developed by Chinese military scientists.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3299550/chinas-tiantuo-satellite-breakthrough-enables-global-cargo-surveillance-pla-scientists", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/02/21/9b787a5e-7a44-45fb-b2b4-7c7ea642bf56_7671afd5.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 04:00:11", "author": "Stephen Chen", "authors": ["Stephen Chen"], "language": "en", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": 0.166}, {"id": 295509514, "title": "In Trump\u2019s Zelensky takedown, Vance puts his stamp on \u2018America First\u2019 policy", "text": "In lighting the match that set off an extraordinary public clash with Ukraine\u2019s leader Volodymyr Zelensky, US Vice-President J.D. Vance has again shown his steely determination in pushing his \u201cAmerica First\u201d world view.\nThe Oval Office meeting between Donald Trump and Zelensky was bound to be awkward due to the two presidents\u2019 tense history and opposing views, but started off on comparatively civil terms, as they discussed plans for a minerals deal.\nMore than half an hour after media started recording, Vance spoke up and urged a turn to diplomacy over war \u2013 moving Zelensky to explain how Russia has violated earlier deals.\nVance, speaking with sangfroid from the facing couch, then told Zelensky that he was being \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and that he should have come to the White House to thank Trump.\nTrump, not one to tolerate questioning of his authority, soon raised his voice with Zelensky and warned him that he had to accept a deal with Russia or be abandoned by the United States.\nZelensky in a later interview on Fox News voiced hope at ending the rift. But he made clear how he felt about Vance\u2019s role.\nThe two presidents can answer questions but \u201cwith all due respect to the vice-president, I mean, he has his [own] interviews,\u201d Zelensky said.\n\nVance as a senator famously said he did not care what happened to Ukraine. After Trump picked him as his running mate, Zelensky told The New Yorker that Vance was \u201ctoo radical\u201d.\nThe clash with Zelensky was the latest bold foray by Vance into pushing US foreign policy sharply away from internationalism.\nVance, who at 40 is one of the youngest vice-presidents in US history and almost half the age of Trump, made his international debut with a February speech urging Germany to break its taboo of dealing with the far-right, whose leader he met.\nSpeaking at the Munich Security Conference, Vance stunned the audience by urging restrictions on immigration and declared of Trump, \u201cThere is a new sheriff in town.\u201d\nOne day before the Zelensky meeting, in a far more cordial meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Vance complained about \u201cinfringements on free speech\u201d by the bedrock US ally \u2013 repeating criticism he made in Munich about restrictions on disinformation and other tech regulation.\nStarmer politely replied that Britain had a \u201cvery proud\u201d history of free speech.\nWith Trump constitutionally prohibited from seeking another term, Vance was the strong favourite to succeed him in a straw poll a week ago at the Conservative Political Action Conference.\nVance, who rose from poverty to Yale Law School, gained national prominence with a book on the struggles of working-class white Americans before heading to Silicon Valley.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been this effort to put Trumpism on a more rigorous academic footing, and Vance is well placed to do that,\u201d said Aaron Mannes, an expert at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy on the national security role of the vice-president.\nThe most effective vice-presidents, he said, know not to air any disagreements with the president publicly.\n\u201cHe is probably following that model. Plus, Trump likes loyalty, so Vance is going the extra mile on that,\u201d Mannes said.\n\nVance has quickly taken a different role than Trump\u2019s vice-president from his first term, Mike Pence, a mild-mannered conservative Christian who starred in memes showing him sitting silently as Trump spoke.\nPence also showed loyalty to Trump \u2013 until January 6, 2021, when the then vice-president refused to throw out results of their election defeat, prompting Trump to berate him and pro-Trump rioters to threaten to kill him.\nOne of the most influential vice-presidents on foreign policy was Dick Cheney, who under George W. Bush championed a sweeping \u201cwar on terror\u201d and the invasion of Iraq.\nMany Bush critics saw him as manipulated by Cheney, who had decades of experience in Washington, although Bush called himself \u201cthe decider\u201d.\nLawmakers on both sides of the political spectrum saw Vance as key to the confrontation with Zelensky.\nSenator Mark Kelly, who alongside fellow Democrats met Zelensky earlier on Friday, told MSNBC that the United States does not \u201cgain anything by acting like bullies\u201d.\n\u201cIt seemed to me it was just J.D.

Alternate Wordle versions created by fans also sprang up, including battle royale Squabble, music identification game Heardle, and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once. Wordle eventually became so popular that it was purchased by the New York Times, and TikTok creators even livestream themselves playing.What's the best Wordle starting word?The best Wordle starting word is the one that speaks to you. But if you prefer to be strategic in your approach, we have a few ideas to help you pick a word that might help you find the solution faster. One tip is to select a word that includes at least two different vowels, plus some common consonants like S, T, R, or N.\n\nWhat happened to the Wordle archive?The entire archive of past Wordle puzzles was originally available for anyone to enjoy whenever they felt like it, but it was later taken down, with the website's creator stating it was done at the request of the New York Times.

The Mixx StreamQ TV Bundle promises to do just that.\n\nThe pair of over-the-ear headphones come with an audio transceiver that streams audio from your TV right into your ears. However, it does a lot more than just that.\n\nThe MIXX StreamQ Surround over-ear wireless Bluetooth headphones offer dynamic, cinema-like 3D surround sound, and are comfortable enough, although they do feel a little plasticky and the battery of around 40 hours is OK, but a little bit off similar-priced devices. There's also no ANC but they do still block plenty over outside noise.\n\nYou can choose between two modes - voice and music, the former ensures crystal-clear dialogue, particularly during speech-heavy scenes, while the later delivers a balanced musical experience with a wide soundstage and rich sound. I found both these modes impactful, especially the voice option as modern-day movies tend to drown out what people are saying! The low-latency Bluetooth also made sure audio was synchronised without lip-sync issues.\n\nThe transmitter mimics the budget feel but is a very useful piece of kit. It can stream audio wirelessly from a TV to one or two sets of StreamQ headphones (via a headphone jack or digital audio port) while simultaneously passing the audio through to a home sound system or soundbar. Now that's pretty impressive on its own but there's more.\n\nSwitching over to receive mode means you can streams music from any Bluetooth-enabled device, such as a smartphone, to a home audio system or soundbar for high-quality wireless playback. This is a terrific option for people looking to easily upgrade an old hi-fi system. I found this worked really well and was the actual feature that I ended up using the most.\n\nAll in all, I found the MIXX StreamQ TV Bundle Pack useful and feature-packed. Being able to listen to film or TV show as loud as I liked without bothering others. The build qualify was a tad concerning, not so much with the transmitter but with the headphones themselves, especially when compared to simillar-priced over-the-ear options.\n\nAlternatives", "summary": "Pair of over-the-ear headphones come with an audio transceiver that streams audio from your TV", "url": "https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/review-mixx-streamq-tv-fires-31049863", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article31049853.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_TV-Bundle_BOX-COVER-IMAGE.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 07:00:00", "author": "Daniel Smith", "authors": ["Daniel Smith"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.539}, {"id": 295552624, "title": "\u0110\u1ed3ng minh h\u00f3a \u0111\u1ed1i t\u00e1c", "text": "H\u00e0n Qu\u1ed1c xem x\u00e9t \u00e1p d\u1ee5ng thu\u1ebf ch\u1ed1ng b\u00e1n ph\u00e1 gi\u00e1 v\u1edbi th\u00e9p c\u1ee7a Trung Qu\u1ed1c\n\n \u1ee6y ban Th\u01b0\u01a1ng m\u1ea1i H\u00e0n Qu\u1ed1c s\u1ebd nh\u00f3m h\u1ecdp v\u00e0o tu\u1ea7n t\u1edbi \u0111\u1ec3 th\u1ea3o lu\u1eadn, xem x\u00e9t kh\u1ea3 n\u0103ng \u00e1p thu\u1ebf ch\u1ed1ng b\u00e1n ph\u00e1 gi\u00e1 \u0111\u1ed1i v\u1edbi s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m th\u00e9p t\u1ea5m d\u00e0y nh\u1eadp kh\u1ea9u t\u1eeb Trung Qu\u1ed1c.\n\n Th\u00e9p t\u1ea1i nh\u00e0 m\u00e1y c\u1ee7a Ben Gang Group Corporation \u1edf t\u1ec9nh Li\u00eau Ninh, Trung Qu\u1ed1c. \u1ea2nh: THX/TTXVN\n\nN\u1ed9i dung tr\u00ean \u0111\u00e3 \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c m\u1ed9t s\u1ed1 ngu\u1ed3n tin th\u00e2n c\u1eadn trong ch\u00ednh quy\u1ec1n c\u1ee7a H\u00e0n Qu\u1ed1c ti\u1ebft l\u1ed9 v\u00e0o ng\u00e0y 13/2.

We were using the cordless version of the Enabot ROLA Smart Pet Water Fountain, although you can also pick up a corded version for around a tenner less.\n\nThe ROLA provides pets with fresh, clean water while claiming to offer safety and convenience for owners. On unpacking there's a little bit of assembly required but nothing too arduous. \n\nOnce set up, filled up and linked to your phone via the Enabot app, you're ready to go. The fountain has a sensor meaning it starts pumping out water when it detects anything coming near it (be it you or your pet).\n\nThe fountain includes a filtration system that removes impurities, hair and microorganisms, creating a hygienic drinking environment. The. The 2lt water tank provides up to seven days of water with few refills, and the detachable design allows for easy cleaning.\n\nBattery life on the cordless version is excellent - lasting up to 60 days on a single charge. You'll need to clean it out once a week, however, and replace the main filter every couple of weeks and a sponge every month. You only get one of each initially which took me back a little. Picking up a bundle of six filters and three sponges will set you back \u00a320 so there is some considerable ongoing costs.\n\nThe ROLA is whisper quiet and, after a few days looking at is suspiciously, our cat was happy using it. The app monitors how often your cat drops by and also reminds you when it's time to change the filters and/or give it a clean.\n\nIt's nice to look at and has a compact design. For the price, it's a decent buy. However, those ongoing costs might give you pause.\n\nEnabot ROLA Smart Pet Water Fountain for intelligent, convenient and safe pet hydration available for \u00a334 for the corded version and \u00a349.99 for the cordless battery powered version via Amazon.\n\nWhat users say\n\nNick says: My cat is too timid and runs away when the sensor is triggered and the water runs. Hopefully, he will get use to it and use it soon. I think it's too big as it takes over his feeding area. The app is useful because you have control over the water fountain modes and can see usage statistics. Anyone can trigger the sensor so it's not always your cat that's setting it off so statistics may be inaccurate. Still it is useful for water level, you will know if your pet is drinking or not.\n\nAthos says: Everyone in our family really likes this water fountain including us and the cat as well. Out cat really liked that it offers her a great opportunity to drink water her favorite way. She really likes to drink water straight from the stream. But sometimes she also likes to drink the water from the flat surface, like from a bowl. \n\nAlternatives", "summary": "The ROLA provides pets with fresh, clean water while claiming to offer safety and convenience for owners", "url": "https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/review-enabot-rola-smart-pet-31100759", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article31100738.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_crufts1.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 07:00:00", "author": "Daniel Smith", "authors": ["Daniel Smith"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.412}, {"id": 295552620, "title": "Wales breaking news plus weather and traffic updates (Saturday, March 1)", "text": "M4 PRINCE OF WALES BRIDGE - MONMOUTHSHIRE - BOTH DIRECTIONS - BRISTOL - One lane closed due to resurfacing work and contraflow on M4 Prince of Wales Bridge in both directions between J22 M49 and J23 M48.

In front of a packed media crowd, the Ukrainian president, Mr Trump and vice president JD Vance spoke over and interrupted each other. The US president accused Mr Zelensky of \"gambling with World War Three\" and his deputy said the Ukrainian leader was being \"disrespectful\", claiming he had not been thankful for US military aid. Plans for the two countries to sign a Ukrainian minerals deal in exchange for continued US support were also put on hold as Mr Zelensky abruptly left the White House. The Sun labels Mr Zelensky a \"global hero\" who \"led his wronged country's brave defence against a tyrant's war machine\". \"His ambush by Donald Trump and his vice-president as the world watched was a shocking spectacle,\" the newspaper writes. \"Zelensky flew to Washington hoping to secure Ukraine's future, only to be degraded and sent home with no minerals deal. \"His courage and leadership have earned him far more respect than the undeserved humiliation he received on live TV.\" Sentiments are echoed by the Daily Mirror, which also describes the interaction as an \"ambush\" and Mr Trump as a \"bully\". \"One is leading his country's fight for survival,\" the editorial says. \"The other prefers to showboat in front of TV cameras as if he is on The Apprentice.\" But Mr Trump's deputy does not escape unscathed. The Independent claims Mr Vance was in \"performative propaganda mode\", labelling the conflict \"one of the most shameful episodes in the history of American diplomacy\". And the Daily Telegraph writes the White House leadership was in the wrong \"factually, geopolitically and morally\", labelling Mr Trump's outburst \"unprecedented\". \"The Western alliance appears to be on the brink,\" the newspaper says, later adding: \"It was a chilling scene which will have worried everyone in Britain and Europe concerned for the security of their continent.\" But iWeekend rules Ukraine's president \"maintained his dignity\" even if he \"showed too little diplomacy when it might have benefited his people\". \"The provocations came from Trump and JD Vance, whose crass attempt to embarrass Zelensky will delight their supporters but dismay America's allies,\" it read. \"Putin must be laughing his head off.\" Others maintain more neutrality, instead focusing on the \"uncharted waters\" now surrounding Ukrainian peace talks and the groundwork laid by Sir Keir Starmer during his White House visit on Thursday, in which he sought to ensure a \"US backstop\" for European peacekeeping forces. \"British policy on Ukraine has been thrown into turmoil,\" The Times writes. \"With no US guarantee - and that situation is likely to persist so long as Mr Zelensky remains in power - deploying troops to Ukraine seems like a non-starter. \"Britain and its Nato allies in Europe simply lack the means by themselves to deter Russian forces.\" Read more here: Trump\u2019s disgraceful attack on Ukraine\u2019s Zelensky shows why UK needs billions to rearm Similarly, the Daily Express calls the \"fractious meeting\" a \"sharp reminder of the gravity of the Ukraine crisis\". \"The last thing the world needs is a row between two democracies while Vladimir Putin's forces are working to cement gains,\" the editorial adds. Ending its editorial on a sombre note, The Guardian reports Sunday's defence summit of European leaders in London is \"more crucial than ever\" after Mr Trump's \"blistering\" attack on Ukraine's leader. \"The extent of their erstwhile ally's betrayal is now undeniable. \" Kyiv is the first but not the only victim. \"The extent to which European countries are able to formulate a plan for acting accordingly, and in unison, will be critical to Ukraine's future, and to the continent's.\"", "summary": "\"The provocations came from Trump and JD Vance, whose crass attempt to embarrass Zelensky will delight their supporters but dismay America's allies,\"", "url": "https://www.scotsman.com/news/ambush-appalling-media-reacts-to-trump-and-zelenskys-showdown-5012936", "image": "https://www.scotsman.com/webimg/b25lY21zOjUxMWQ1ODZkLTJmMGYtNDc4Ni04OTdmLTkzMTQxNmEzMDhjYzphYjgyZGI3Mi1iYTFhLTRmYzctODNkZi1lNjQxYjI3OTM2YTk=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 09:02:25", "author": "Amy Watson", "authors": ["Amy Watson"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.045}, {"id": 295589696, "title": "BGT 2025 odds: who is the early favourite to win Britain\u2019s Got Talent?

It traditionally doesn\u2019t return to ITV until the spring, however due to the hiatus of Ant and Dec\u2019s Saturday Night Takeaway it returned in February. It will air weekly through to the end of May and in a twist the live semi-finals will not run on consecutive nights. They will also be broadcast weekly, once the competition has reached that stage.

We\u2019ve taken a look at what the start of meteorological spring actually means, for example, if the weather will be warmer and when the clocks will go forward. The meteorological seasons are four periods of the year made up of three months each. The seasons are split to coincide with our Gregorian calendar, making it easier for meteorological observing and forecasting to compare seasonal and monthly statistics. In the meteorological calendar, spring will always start on March 1 and end on May 31. According to the Met Office, the weather in the UK during spring is often calm and dry due to the Atlantic losing heat during autumn and winter, leading to less heat and moisture being transferred to the atmosphere. The forecaster says the sun is high in the sky during spring meaning temperatures can rise in the day, but stay cool at night due to the moderating effect of the ocean temperature. Spring temperatures in the UK are largely influenced by latitude, with northern parts of the UK like Scotland seeing cooler temperatures compared to the lower latitudes and the southern parts of the UK which experience warmer temperatures. Despite it being the start of spring, the clocks don\u2019t go forward until the last Sunday of the month - March 30.

\u201cAlex Marlow Show,\u201d Toronto Sun Political Columnist Brian Lilley talked about the scope of China\u2019s infiltration in Canada, including how they\u2019ve interfered in Canadian elections.\n\nLilley said, \u201cWe know that in the last two federal elections, in Canada, that China has interfered to try and help Justin Trudeau secure victory. We had a national public inquiry on that\u2026a judge put in charge, hearings held, most of the juicy stuff was kept secret. There was a plot uncovered of eleven different candidates \u2014 now, they were divided between the two parties, because this is how China operates, they don\u2019t target just one \u2014 eleven candidates in the Toronto area, a claim of 250,000 dollars distributed to various candidates through an intermediary from the Chinese consulate to these local elections.

Having Cris in the starting XI wouldn\u2019t work with the way we wanted to play, and that\u2019s why Erik preferred Anthony Martial,\u201d Benni McCarthy added.\nWhile Anthony Martial was initially seen by Manchester United team management as a reliable figure, the trust did not last long. In September last year, Martial moved to AEK Athens on a three-year deal. Ten Hag was sacked as Manchester United\u2019s manager in October 2024.\nCristiano Ronaldo\u2019s association with Manchester United came to an end after he agreed to a mutual termination of his contract after his explosive interview. In that interview, the Portuguese legend had criticised Manchester United and former manager Erik ten Hag. Having left Manchester United, Ronaldo joined Saudi Pro League outfit Al Nassr. The five-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner has been in spectacular form at Al Nassr. Ronaldo\u2019s contract at Al Nassr is scheduled to come to an end in June.\nAl Nassr are currently placed at the third spot in the Saudi Pro League standings.

But that position of pride is of little value because they are set to face either Australia or most likely South Africa in the last four, and both of them have handy spin units at their disposal.\nIndian batters have not been really comfortable against spin despite two victories thus far in the event, and New Zealand, who are also qualified for the semifinals, could offer them a tough challenge.\nThe star Indian batters were focusing more on playing out Bangladesh spinners Mehidy Hasan Miraz (0/37) and Rishad Hossain (2/38) without taking risks, and they followed the same approach against Pakistan leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed (1/28).\nBut they will come up against more wily customers in Mitchell Santner and Michael Bracewell on Sunday, and it could be their harshest test against spin yet in this event.\nBoth the Kiwi spinners are in fine fettle here, and could be even more effective on the worn out surface at Dubai.\nIndian batters have been clever enough to milk spinners for singles and twos, while reserving the big shots against pacers when the ball came much more quickly and predictably at them.\nBut they will face 20 overs from Santner and Bracewell while a few more of Glenn Phillips\u2019 part-time off-spin.\nIndia do not have very fond memories of facing Santner and Phillips in a Test series at home late last year, which they lost 0-3, and now they have Bracewell too to tackle.\nThe off-spinner has been quite parsimonious so far, conceding just 3.2 runs per over across two matches.\nSo, the effectiveness of Shubman Gill, India\u2019s standout batter in ODIs of late, batting icon Virat Kohli, who made a morale-boosting 100 against Pakistan, Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul against them will have a telling impact on the outcome of the game.\nAnd even beyond this match, considering the slowing-down nature of the decks at the DICS.\nSpinners To The Fore\nBut there is a pleasing side to spinners\u2019 dominance here.\nThe selection of five spinners \u2014 Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, Washington Sundar \u2014 was not viewed with any conviction ahead of the marquee event because of the overwhelming success pacers had at this venue in the past.\nBut what India encountered at Dubai are tired pitches after the venue hosted the ILT20 recently, vindicating the selection call to a large extent.\nThe three tweakers India employed so far \u2014 Jadeja, Axar and Kuldeep \u2014 have bowled as per the conditions, making it tough for their opponents.\nThey have not produced any magical spells but were able to keep the opposition batters in check in the middle overs, as none of them have given in excess of five runs per over in this event.\nThe match against Pakistan stands as a prime example for this. Despite constructing a 100-plus stand Mohammad Rizwan and Saud Shakeel were never able to accelerate between the 11th and 34th over \u2014 a phase when Indian spinners applied the brakes remarkably well.\nIn fact, the Pakistan batters could not find a boundary for nine overs on the trot.\nBut they might just face a different scenario against New Zealand as batters such as Kane Williamson, Will Young, Tom Latham, Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra etc are excellent against spin.\nIf the Indian spinners can contain them, then it will do a world of good to their already high confidence.\nChance For Fringe Players?\nWhile India would want to sustain the momentum, they will think of giving skipper Rohit Sharma and Mohammed Shami some more time to hit the peak ahead of the semifinals.\nRohit had experienced some discomfort during the match against Pakistan and stayed away from the field for some 20 minutes before returning. He batted too without any obvious struggle.\nBut with no tournament riders hanging on this match, the management will be tempted to give Rohit a break. If that is the case, Rishabh Pant may get his first match here.\nThere will also be a discussion on resting Mohammed Shami because he had struggled with his calf during the match against Pakistan, and the think tank might just give him an extended recovery break ahead of the semis on March 4.\nHence, Arshdeep Singh could come in for Shami, and the in-form Chakravarthy might replace Kuldeep as he is also coming off an injury lay-off.\nFull Squad:\nIndia: Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohd.

We\u2019ve taken a look at what the start of meteorological spring actually means, for example, if the weather will be warmer and when the clocks will go forward. The meteorological seasons are four periods of the year made up of three months each. The seasons are split to coincide with our Gregorian calendar, making it easier for meteorological observing and forecasting to compare seasonal and monthly statistics. In the meteorological calendar, spring will always start on March 1 and end on May 31. According to the Met Office, the weather in the UK during spring is often calm and dry due to the Atlantic losing heat during autumn and winter, leading to less heat and moisture being transferred to the atmosphere. The forecaster says the sun is high in the sky during spring meaning temperatures can rise in the day, but stay cool at night due to the moderating effect of the ocean temperature. Spring temperatures in the UK are largely influenced by latitude, with northern parts of the UK like Scotland seeing cooler temperatures compared to the lower latitudes and the southern parts of the UK which experience warmer temperatures. Despite it being the start of spring, the clocks don\u2019t go forward until the last Sunday of the month - March 30.

It wasn\u2019t a problem for us.\u2019\n\nBourdain honed his craft as a chef working in New York City in the 1980s and 1990s, at one point attaining the position of executive chef Brasserie Les Halles.\n\nBourdain\u2019s profile rose significantly with the 1999 publication of a series of essays in The New Yorker titled Don\u2019t Eat Before Reading This.\n\nHe became what Deadline described as \u2018an instant star on the media food scene\u2019 for his frank, blunt manner of communication that separated him from his peers.\n\nHe went on to host and appear in a number of culinary TV shows, including Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown on CNN; Raw Craft; The Mind of a Chef on PBS; The Taste; and Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations on the Travel Channel.\n\nHis star continued to rise with the release of his 2000 book Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly, which blended details of his own life and career with his views on the restaurant business.\n\nIn the wake of his death, Bourdain was mourned far and wide, with condolences coming from a number of fans and celebrities he had crossed paths with.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, who appeared with Bourdain on Parts Unknown in 2016, said on Twitter, \u2018He taught us about food \u2013 but more importantly, about its ability to bring us together. To make us a little less afraid of the unknown. We\u2019ll miss him.\u2019\n\nFellow celeb chef Jamie Oliver said on Instagram that the death of the culinary innovator left \u2018chefs and fans around the world with a massive foodie hole that simply can\u2019t be replaced.\u2019\n\nIn the year prior to his passing, Bourdain also gained notoriety for his outspoken criticism of tPresident Donald Trump; and his support for women amid the #MeToo movement.\n\nArgento, had accused since-convicted producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault.\n\nBourdain said at the time on Medium, \u2018I stand unhesitatingly and unwaveringly with the women.\u2019\n\nArgento said in a tweet following Bourdain\u2019s passing that she was \u2018beyond devastated,\u2019 and that the chef\u2019s \u2018brilliant, fearless spirit touched and inspired so many, and his generosity knew no bounds.\u2019\n\nActress Rose McGowan, who also accused Weinstein of sexual assault, said in a clip online, \u2018Anthony I am so mad at you \u2013 you were so loved, the world is not better without you. I have a message for those considering suicide as a solution to a temporary problem. Please call a hotline.\u2019\n\nBourdain was father to daughter Ariane Bourdain, 17, with then-wife Ottavia Busia-Bourdain.\n\nIn a 2008 interview with the AP, Bourdain had said that his daughter\u2019s birth had changed his outlook on life. \u2018I feel obliged to at least do the best I can and not do anything really stupidly self-destructive if I can avoid it,\u2019 he said.\n\nBesides showcasing food, a Parts Unknown also served as a window to the local culture \u2014 particularly the parts not overrun by tourists. A trip to Japan in the series\u2019 first season included an odd show with robots and scantily clad women, a visit with a death metal band and a meal shared with a woman involved in the city\u2019s sadomasochistic community.\n\nBourdain was reluctant to analyze why his series succeeded.\n\n\u2018If you think about who the audience is and what their expectations might be, I think that\u2019s the road to badness and mediocrity,\u2019 he told the AP. \u2018You go out there and show the best story you can as best you can. If it\u2019s interesting to you, hopefully it\u2019s interesting to others. If you don\u2019t make television like that, it\u2019s pandering.\u2019\n\nBourdain was born in New York City and was raised in Leonia, New Jersey. He had written that his love of food began as a youth while on a family vacation in France, when he ate his first oyster. He was candid about his personal struggles, saying that drug use led to his dropping out of Vassar College after two years.\n\nWorking in restaurants led him to the Culinary Institute of America, where he graduated in 1978, and began working in kitchens in New York City. He became executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles in 1998.\n\nIn the preface to the latest edition Kitchen Confidential, Bourdain wrote of his shock at the success of his book, which he wrote by getting up at 5 a.m. to steal a couple of hours at the computer before appearing at the saute station for lunch.\n\nHe said he never intended to write an expose or to \u2018rip the lid off the restaurant business,\u2019 as he said he liked the restaurant business the way it was.\n\n\u2018What I set out to do was write a book that my fellow cooks would find entertaining and true,\u2019 he said. \u2018I wanted it to sound like me talking at say \u2026 ten o\u2019clock on a Saturday night, after a busy dinner rush, me and a few cooks hanging around in the kitchen, knocking back a few beers and talking.\u2019\n\nBourdain said he really had no idea that anyone outside the world of chefs would even pay attention to his comments.\n\n\u2018The new celebrity chef culture is a remarkable and admittedly annoying phenomenon. While it\u2019s been nothing but good for business \u2013 and for me personally \u2013 many of us in the life can\u2019t help snickering about it,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018Of all the professions, after all, few people are less suited to be suddenly thrown into the public eye than chefs.\u2019\n\nFor confidential support in the UK, call the Samaritans on 116123 or visit www.samaritans.org for details; In the US call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255)", "summary": "Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAnthony Bourdain&#8217;s chilling final text before his shock death aged 61 in&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The last message sent by Anthony Bourdain before his death at the age of 61 is shared. first appeared on Internewscast Journal", "url": "https://internewscast.com/news/us/the-last-message-sent-by-anthony-bourdain-before-his-death-at-the-age-of-61-is-shared/", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/28/20/88464255-0-Anthony_Bourdain_s_chilling_final_text_before_his_shock_suicide_-m-45_1740774732998.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:05:48", "author": "Internewscast", "authors": ["Internewscast"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.005}, {"id": 295542362, "title": "Pope Francis battles pneumonia while \u2018Conclave\u2019 heads towards Academy Awards", "text": "VATICAN CITY \u2013 There has long been a Vatican taboo against openly talking about a conclave when a pope is sick: It\u2019s considered gauche to speculate about the election of a new pope while the current one is fighting for his life. And that is certainly true as Pope Francis battles double pneumonia at Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital.\n\nBut the surprising success of \u201cConclave\u201d the film and momentum going into Sunday\u2019s Academy Awards have thrust the arcane rules, glorious ceremony and supreme drama of one of the Catholic Church\u2019s most solemn moments into popular culture, and put the Catholic hierarchy in something of a bind as it simultaneously prays for Francis.\n\nThe film can\u2019t be dismissed as distasteful or blasphemous, since it treats the gravity of a papal election with respect and accurately portrays the ancient rituals and contemporary problems facing today\u2019s Catholic Church. Both the Vatican newspaper L\u2019Osservatore Romano and the Avvenire daily of the Italian bishops conference gave \u201cConclave\u201d rave reviews.\n\nGranted, those reviews were published before Francis entered the hospital Feb. 14 with a complex lung infection that has taken him out of commission for the longest time of his 12-year papacy.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the newspapers would have published them after Francis\u2019 health took such a dire turn. That\u2019s even more the case since it\u2019s clear from the opening scenes in the Vatican\u2019s modern Santa Marta hotel where Francis lives that \u201cConclave\u2019s\u201d fictional dead pope is modeled after the real-life current one.\n\nBut at the very least, the life-imitating-art coincidence of \u201cConclave\u201d the movie finding mass popular appeal at a time when the world\u2019s media has descended on Rome to monitor Francis\u2019 health has certainly piqued interest in what might happen in a real-life conclave.\n\nAuthor Harris knows it\u2019s a sensitive time\n\n\u201cConclave,\u201d director Edward Berger\u2019s adaptation of the Robert Harris novel starring Ralph Fiennes as the dean of the College of Cardinals, has been nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture. It goes into Sunday\u2019s Oscars with a Bafta win for best picture and a SAG award for best ensemble.\n\nHarris is well aware of the sensitivity of the moment, and how the surreal turn of events of an ailing pope dovetailing with an Oscar campaign had made his book and the film relevant to say the least. But he is adamant against trying to milk the moment for publicity.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been refusing all requests to talk about it and a future conclave because I think that\u2019s in extreme bad taste,\u201d Harris told The Associated Press. \u201cI really hope he\u2019s got some more years yet.\u201d\n\nFrancis suffered a setback on Friday, after he inhaled vomit during a coughing fit and required non-invasive mechanical ventilation to breathe. Doctors said they need 24 to 48 hours to evaluate how and if the isolated episode affected his overall clinical condition, while keeping his prognosis guarded.\n\nAll of which has made \u201cConclave\u201d the film a bit too close for comfort in more ways than one for anyone following Francis\u2019 plight and concerned about what it means for the Catholic Church.\n\nMild spoiler alert\n\nTo recap: The film opens with the death of the pope and turns around the political maneuvering and manipulations behind the election of his successor. Cardinal Thomas Lawrence (Fiennes) is dean of the College of Cardinals, who must organize the conclave amid his own crisis of faith.\n\nWith the future of the church weighing on him, he has to contend with secrets, scandals, smear campaigns and surprising twists, while ensuring the election\u2019s integrity.\n\nMassimo Faggioli, theologian at Villanova University, said the film was \u201csadly effective\u201d in illustrating the institutional instability that the Catholic Church is going through now, as well as the ease with which a single act or allegation of misconduct can ruin someone.\n\n\u201cThe main threats (are) now coming not from the outside (Napoleon, or Hitler, or secularization), but from the inside (especially the fear of another sexual scandal),\u201d he said.\n\nFor sure Berger takes some creative liberties. Cardinal Lawrence, for example, would have been excommunicated two or possibly three times for his efforts to navigate the intrigue, given the ban on communications with the outside world during a conclave and canon laws governing the seal of the confessional and the sealing of the papal apartments after a pope has died.\n\nBut this is Hollywood, and His Eminence can be forgiven.\n\nCatholic media loved the film\n\nAvvenire, which hews to the Vatican establishment line, praised the film for its sumptuous beauty, twists of plot and \u201canything but trivial\u201d commentary about the current state of the church.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it: \u2018Conclave,\u2019 which takes us to the heart of one of the world\u2019s most mysterious and secret events, is a highly entertaining film, especially for an American audience that isn\u2019t terribly picky,\u201d Avvenire said on Dec. 20, when the film opened in Italian theaters and well before Francis got sick.\n\nWriting in the Vatican newspaper L\u2019Osservatore Romano on Feb. 1, critic Alessandra Comazzi highlighted the short but critical turn played by Isabella Rossellini, as Sister Agnes.\n\nAs a longtime critic for the La Stampa daily, Comazzi is well aware of the Vatican taboo of openly talking of a conclave. But in an interview, she said the film managed to treat a conclave as thriller without causing offense. She said the Vatican newspaper was only too happy to publish her rave.\n\n\u201cThe dean Lawrence has to govern the conclave and liberate it from these false prophets,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think also from the ecclesial and religious point of view, the director managed to do it in a very respectful way.\u201d\n\nBut a cardinal close to Francis didn\u2019t\n\nThat said, someone who has actually participated in a conclave gave the film something of a thumbs down.\n\n\u201cMy experience of being in at least one conclave was not that it was some sort of scene of political backroom plotting of how to get your candidate elected,\u201d Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, the retired archbishop of Boston, wrote in a Feb. 7 blog post.\n\nO\u2019Malley voted in the 2013 conclave that elected Francis pope and is one of his closest allies. He said he and his brother cardinals were well aware that millions of Catholics were praying from afar \u201cso that the Holy Spirit would guide us in our deliberations.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd, of course, at the moment when each cardinal votes, you take your ballot, stand in front of Michelangelo\u2019s image of Christ in the \u2018Last Judgment\u2019 and swear before God that you are going to vote for the person that you believe is God\u2019s will for the church,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a much different experience than what they depicted in the movie,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFor all its artistic and entertainment value, I don\u2019t think the movie is a good portrayal of the spiritual reality of what a conclave is.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press writer Hilary Fox in London contributed to this report.\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\u2019s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

call records from Justin Baldoni is turned down", "text": "Blake Lively suffered a blow in her defamation battle with Justin Baldoni Friday after a judge blocked her efforts to make him surrender more than two years\u2019 worth of texts and call data.\n\nLively, 37, subpoenaed her It Ends With Us co-star for \u2018documents concerning ingoing and outgoing calls or text messages \u2026 within the time period of December 1, 2022 to the present\u2019.\n\nThe itemized demands included \u2018call logs, text logs, data logs, and cell site location information.\u2019\n\nBut a New York court agreed with Baldoni, 41, that the actress\u2019s discovery request was \u2018overly intrusive and disproportionate\u2019, in a ruling obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com.\n\nFederal Judge Lewis Liman said the trove of data would be so vast it could include communications with nonparties or sensitive information related to doctors and psychologists.\n\nHe also questioned why Lively needed texts dating back more than two years in her attempt to prove that Baldoni and staff from his Wayfarer production company started to harass her in 2024.\n\n\u2018Lively mainly argues that the subpoenas will help to identify \u2018the larger network of individuals\u2019 who perpetuated a negative media campaign against her,\u2019 he remarked.\n\n\u2018But according to Lively\u2019s complaint, this negative campaign did not begin until approximately August 2024 \u2026 it is therefore unclear how communications to and from Wayfarer Parties in 2022 and 2023 would reveal individuals who participated in the campaign.\u2019\n\nJudge Liman told mom-of-four Lively to rework her subpoenas but did not quash them entirely.\n\nBaldoni\u2019s lawyers wanted to stop her from asking third parties for similar discovery materials but Liman tossed that argument.\n\n\u2018The Wayfarer parties may assert a privacy interest in their own phone records, but they have not provided any basis for asserting an interest in the communications of non-parties,\u2019 he said in a six-page filing.\n\nThe ruling comes months into the bitter legal war between Lively and Baldoni, whose on-screen chemistry nonetheless made their 2024 adaptation of Colleen Hoover\u2019s acclaimed novel It Ends With Us a box office hit.\n\nLively kicked off hostilities with a California civil rights complaint and subsequent federal lawsuit, claiming Baldoni \u2013 who was both director and co-star \u2013 had entered her trailer while she was topless, showed her graphic video of his wife giving birth and bit and sucked on her lips during an improvised kissing scene.\n\nShe further accused him of smearing her reputation when she objected to the alleged abuse, citing a text message from Baldoni\u2019s publicist Melissa Nathan which read: \u2018We can bury anyone.\u2019\n\nLively\u2019s bombshell claims made global headlines thanks to the near-simultaneous publication of a 4,000-word New York Times expose that quoted heavily from the civil rights complaint.\n\nBaldoni countersued Lively and her Hollywood actor husband Ryan Reynolds, turning the spat on its head by claiming it was their team doing the smearing and asking for $400 million in damages.\n\nHe accused her of twisting the meaning of his texts and emails and working in tandem with Leslie Sloane, a powerful Hollywood publicist, to plant damaging stories about him in the media.\n\nIt was all a ploy, Baldoni argued, to rebuild Lively\u2019s reputation after she came in for criticism for being prickly and difficult in interviews and promotional events.\n\nAny negative publicity surrounding his blonde leading lady had arisen \u2018organically\u2019, his suit contends.\n\nBaldoni also sued The Times for $250million, claiming it \u2018relied almost entirely on Lively\u2019s unverified and self-serving narrative, lifting it nearly verbatim while disregarding an abundance of evidence that contradicted her claims.\u2019\n\nThe newspaper says it plans to \u2018vigorously defend\u2019 itself.\n\nBaldoni\u2019s team earlier this month released a website which includes private communications such as text messages that were included in court filings detailing his interactions with the Hollywood power couple over the making of romantic drama. \n\nHe claimed in court filings that Lively\u2019s team made efforts to usurp and undermine his input as the director of It Ends With Us.\n\nBaldoni\u2019s team previously said that the communications shared in court filings on the website makes things clear about the motives of both parties, marking the latest chapter in the feud between the headliners.\n\nThe website, thelawsuitinfo.com, comes amid a spate of high-profile litigation between the collaborators on the film. \n\nThe site went live days prior to the first hearing, ahead of a trial which is due to start on March 9, 2026. \n\nLively filed an 80-page civil rights complaint with the California Civil Rights Department against Baldoni December 20, before officially filing a federal lawsuit on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nHer case claims Baldoni sexual harassed her during production of the movie. The Gossip Girl alum accused him of body shaming her and orchestrating a smear campaign against her to damage her reputation. \n\nBaldoni and his reps have said in response to the lawsuit that Lively twisted the meaning of text messages and misled the public about their interactions while making the motion picture. \n\nIn her lawsuit, Lively named a number of Baldoni\u2019s collaborators, including his company Wayfarer Studios, the studio\u2019s CEO and financial backer, and PR personnel Nathan and Jennifer Abel. \n\n\u2018I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted,\u2019 Lively told the Times the day after she filed the complaint.", "summary": "Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nBlake Lively\u00a0suffered a blow in her defamation battle with Justin Baldoni\u00a0Friday after&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Blake Lively faces disappointment as request for text and call records from Justin Baldoni is turned down first appeared on Internewscast Journal", "url": "https://internewscast.com/news/blake-lively-faces-disappointment-as-request-for-text-and-call-records-from-justin-baldoni-is-turned-down/", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/28/19/95283231-14448179-Blake_Lively_was_essentially_contradicting_her_previous_actions_-m-25_1740771562426.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:03:46", "author": "Internewscast", "authors": ["Internewscast"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.132}, {"id": 295542360, "title": "Vance strongly supports Trump\u2019s foreign policy, leading to a remarkable altercation in the Oval Office.", "text": "President Donald Trump, ready to wrap up his Oval Office meeting Friday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, asked for one last question from the reporters gathered in the room.\n\nThat\u2019s when Vice President JD Vance jumped in instead, responding to a previous question about Trump\u2019s relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin by praising Trump\u2019s diplomatic approach to the war in Ukraine.\n\nHis comments yielded a sharp rejoinder from Zelenskyy, steering an already tense discussion into an unexpected, full-blown, high-volume argument for the world to watch.\n\nFor the next seven minutes, Vance and Trump exchanged increasingly heated words with their visitor. Vance accused Zelenskyy of being disrespectful in the White House, of not being thankful enough for U.S. assistance and of embarking on a \u201cpropaganda tour.\u201d\n\nZelenskyy pointedly questioned Vance\u2019s authority on Ukraine, asking if he\u2019d ever been to the country, prompting Vance to reply that he\u2019d \u201cwatched and seen the stories.\u201d Then Trump tagged in, coming to his vice president\u2019s defense by demanding that Zelenskyy be more thankful and asserting that the Ukrainian leader was \u201cgambling with World War III.\u201d\n\nIt was, in the words of Matthew Bartlett, a Republican strategist and State Department appointee during Trump\u2019s first term, \u201ca horrible day for the peacemakers.\u201d\n\nIt was also a sign of how Vance, who as a senator was known for his opposition to U.S. aid for Ukraine, is asserting himself on matters of foreign policy immediately as vice president. Earlier this month, Vance made waves at the Munich Security Conference with a speech that took sharp aim at other world leaders. And on Thursday, the day before tangling with Zelenskyy, Vance mixed it up in an Oval Office meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer \u2014 albeit in a much lighter tone.\n\n\u201cLook, I said what I said,\u201d Vance responded Thursday when a reporter asked him about his comments in Munich that were critical of alleged free speech violations in the United Kingdom.\n\nStarmer replied politely: \u201cIn relation to free speech in the U.K., I\u2019m very proud of our history there.\u201d\n\nThe confrontation Friday with Zelenskyy was far frostier \u2014 spurred not by a reporter\u2019s question but, according to those close to the vice president, by Vance\u2019s desire to push back on what he believed was Zelenskyy\u2019s inappropriate behavior in a diplomatic environment.\n\n\u201cThe path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy,\u201d Vance said after pre-empting Trump\u2019s attempt to field one last inquiry from the media. \u201cWe tried the pathway of Joe Biden, of thumping our chest and pretending that the president of the United States\u2019 words mattered more than the president of the United States\u2019 actions. What makes America a good country is America engaging in diplomacy. That\u2019s what President Trump is doing.\u201d\n\nZelenskyy then asked for and received permission to address Vance directly, noting that Ukraine had previously made diplomatic agreements with Russia that were then violated.\n\n\u201cHe killed our people, and he didn\u2019t exchange prisoners,\u201d a visibly agitated Zelenskyy said, referring to Putin, who has been at war with Ukraine for three years. \u201cWhat kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? What do you mean?\u201d\n\nVance shot back that it was \u201cdisrespectful\u201d for Zelenskyy to \u201ccome to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.\u201d Things only got more tense from there.\n\nAn earlier meeting Friday between Zelenskyy and senators was \u201cvery bipartisan and very supportive,\u201d Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said. Asked about the more rancorous tone in the Oval Office, Whitehouse said: \u201cThat\u2019s what you get for letting Vance in the room.\u201d\n\nA source familiar with the planning for the Trump meeting said there was no predetermined strategy for Vance to confront Zelenskyy the way he did.

She was really on my case.\n\nAt first, I resisted. \n\nI\u2019d long been interested in the subject, not least because of my family history, but I was in denial cancer would ever come for me.\n\nI\u2019d supported the great work of Donald Trump\u2019s son, Eric, raising millions with the St Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital and hosted a charity fundraiser for CLIC Sargent, the childhood cancer specialists, in London with Cherie Blair, lawyer and wife of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nBut me? Cancer? No, that happens to other people. \n\nSarah kept on at me until I finally got checked \u2013 and her fears were confirmed: I had an early-stage tumor around the size of a thumb nail in my breast. \n\nThe fact it was still so small was, of course, down to Sarah\u2019s persistence. \n\nAfter the diagnosis, I assumed I faced a small operation with short recovery time to follow, that I\u2019d continue my film-making career as a matter of course.\n\nIn fact, my nightmare had only begun.\n\nDaily Mail readers might be familiar with some of my projects, such as the first and only print and televised interview with Ghislaine Maxwell from behind bars and the interviews with Britney Spears\u2019 children in which, breaking their years of silence, they begged her to get well and start being part of their lives once again. \n\nMany women may not be aware, but if your mother had breast cancer, your lifetime risk of also being diagnosed is up to 30 percent, compared to the average woman\u2019s risk of 13 percent.\n\nIf your mom had it before age 50, your risk is even higher. \n\nAnd if her cancer was caused by a genetic mutation, your risk is 45-80 percent, depending on the specific mutation.\n\nThe fact my cancer was early-stage meant the operation to remove by tumor would be relatively simple and quick.\n\nMy type of cancer also made me suitable for hormone treatment, which can slow down tumor growth.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nAnd since I was fit, I could cope with a short but intensive five-day course of radiation treatment.\n\nI continued to travel until the operation in April 2024, trying hard not to think about going under the knife or what it might mean for the longer term.\n\nIt was only when my home started filling up with flowers and \u2018You Will Win\u2019 messages of good will that it finally clicked. This was serious.\n\nThe operation was quick. Dr Anne Wallace, the chief breast cancer surgeon in University of California San Diego Hospital (UCSD) used to be a plastic surgeon so, God Bless her, I was delighted to find there was no scar.\n\nWhen the radiation treatment was over, I figured, I was cancer-free.\n\nWell \u2013 not so fast.\n\nI was enjoying myself with friends in Italy when I got the call.\n\nMy cancer was aggressive, I was told, so aggressive that I had a 47 per cent chance of recurrence unless I went through preventative chemo.\n\nFortunately, my oncologist, Prof Becky Shatzky, assured me that advances in research mean that, today, the right balance of chemotherapy and hormone/immune treatment really could protect me in future.\n\nBut I was shaking just listening to it.\n\nMy friends suggested other, more experimental, treatments to avoid the brutal side effects of chemotherapy, such as stem cell therapy and holistic approaches.\n\nBut I decided with my partner, Bill, we were going to beat this cancer for life.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where the hard work really began.\n\nBut it was not without its moments of humor.\n\nDuring chemo, I was given cold cap treatment, which is used to help reduce hair loss during chemotherapy treatments.\n\nLike the name suggests, it involves wearing a special cap that circulates cold liquid around the scalp, constricting blood vessels and reducing the amount of chemotherapy drugs that reach the hair follicles.\n\nI was staying in a hotel next door to the hospital for the treatment since the cap must be changed exactly every 25 minutes.\n\nSo, I had planned to go down to the dining room with the cap on while I waited. I knew the staff and the owner, after all.\n\nBut when they put a heavy seven-pound contraption on my head, I understood why the therapists had been amused by my suggestion.\n\nIt was so heavy, that when I walked they needed to hold my head to stop me breaking my neck.\n\nChemo was no walk in the park. I was in bed, aching all over my body, nauseous, unable to eat.\n\nAfter two weeks, my face was burning as if I\u2019d been scalded.\n\nOne of my eyes closed down, the lid stuck shut. It looked as though I was auditioning for a role in Pirates of the Caribbean.\n\nI was in pain. Vomiting became a regular part of my day. It was a tearful, traumatic process.\n\nAnd while I kept much of my hair. I woke up one morning to discover that I\u2019d lost my long thick eye lashes.\n\nI was staring at the mirror, looking at my eyes \u2013 and they were sort of naked.\n\nDr Wallace promised me that a $70 product , available online would get my eyelashes back in a matter of weeks.\n\nI was doubtful, yet today I\u2019m back \u2013 and so, I\u2019m pleased to say, are the lashes.\n\nSo here is my crucial message:\n\nDo not avoid check-ups, like I did for years, fearing that you might indeed have cancer.\n\nAnd do not be afraid of chemotherapy. It is NOT a death sentence! On the contrary, it is an extension to healthy life.\n\nWhile overall cancer death rates are generally decreasing, the incidence of breast cancer is still on the rise, meaning more cases are being diagnosed each year.\n\nIt\u2019s linked not only to better diagnostics, but also lifestyle and social factors like being overweight or obese, alcohol, lack of exercise, late menopause and having your first child later in life.\n\nFour months after my last chemo session, I am traveling once again, I\u2019m filming a major TV network special \u2013 which you\u2019ll soon be reading all about on Daily Mail.\n\nI am hosting my second cancer charity gala with UCSD hospital, awarding five prominent doctors who saved my life and many others, with top Hollywood and members of the Trump\u2019s top team at the room.\n\nThere have even been some small personal benefits to come from it all. My hair is, if anything, thicker than before. \n\nI\u2019ve always maintained a healthy regime and stayed slim, but now I\u2019m back to what I weighed in my 20s. And the weight is staying off because, for whatever reason, my attitude to food has changed. These days I eat only what I need.\n\nI have a new, more generous perspective on the world.\n\nBut more important than these things, is the fact I\u2019m still alive \u2013 and can expect to be for some time to come.\n\nAnd for that I can thank the four words from Sarah Ferguson\u2019s messages to me, which so many more of us should take the trouble to remember:\n\n\u2018Go, get checked NOW.\u2019\n\nFor more information on my cancer charity gala in California go to: www.gamechangerevents.org", "summary": "Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIt was my friend Sarah Ferguson who finally persuaded me to get&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Beating cancer with the help of the Duchess of York \u2013 My Story of Survival and Hope by a well-known TV host first appeared on Internewscast Journal", "url": "https://internewscast.com/royals/beating-cancer-with-the-help-of-the-duchess-of-york-my-story-of-survival-and-hope-by-a-well-known-tv-host/", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/28/13/95685867-14446925-Daphne_Barak_right_pictured_with_her_friend_Sarah_Ferguson_Duche-a-1_1740750298428.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 06:21:51", "author": "Internewscast", "authors": ["Internewscast"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.115}, {"id": 295536158, "title": "China\u2019s space station to welcome Pakistani astronaut", "text": "China\u2019s space station to welcome Pakistani astronaut as announced the Prime Minister of Pakistan.\n\nIn a major milestone for Pakistan\u2019s space program, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced on Friday that the country, in partnership with China, will launch its first manned space mission to China\u2019s space station.\n\nDuring a ceremony following the signing of an agreement between Pakistan\u2019s Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO) and the China Manned Space Agency, the prime minister described the development as another remarkable step by China to strengthen bilateral space cooperation.\n\nHe highlighted that, under the visionary leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping, China\u2019s space program is advancing rapidly.

Now age 12, Nathan, who plays a character titled \u2018The Boy,\u2019 got a taste of the big time on Thursday where he joined the cast at the film\u2019s premiere at the 2025 Glasgow Film Festival. Speaking to the Evening News, Nathan\u2019s mum Fiona said: \u201cI was super proud - I used to be an extra in productions for years but nothing like this. I was extremely proud to see Nathan in a feature film and it made me very, very emotional. \u201cIt was so special and all the guys that were in it, from Rory McCann to Tim Roth, they were all really lovely people and took Nathan under their wing which was lovely to see, so it was really special last night.\u201d The opportunity to star in the film came after Nathan joined The Performers Agency based in Glasgow. After making a showreel, the youngster was asked to audition for Tornado \u2013 his first ever feature film. The budding actor \u2018couldn\u2019t believe it\u2019 when he was cast in December 2023 after auditioning for the Slow West director John Maclean. In January 2024, the first year pupil at St Kentigern's Academy had to take several weeks off school to film on location near Edinburgh where he worked alongside top talent in the industry. Nathan\u2019s mum said star actor Tim Roth mentored her son during the production, showing him how to go about certain things and reminding him to \u2018just be himself\u2019. Fiona added: \u201cActing is definitely what Nathan wants to do \u2013 he\u2019s always felt that way but after the red carpet event and being a part of the film he said it's even more of a passion for him now.

There have been discussions, traffic counts, speed checks, noise monitoring and a search for alternative routes. But now an update for the council's transport and environment committee says Lothian Buses has reduced the number of buses using East London Street to a minimum; thee is no early prospect of resurfacing the street; and the latest suggestion for re-routing buses has no support. It concludes: \"It is not proposed to take any further action at this time.\" The update says council officers looked at Green Street - which runs parallel to East London Street on the other side of the bus depot - as a possible alternative route, but the layout of the junction with Annandale Street does not allow buses to turn without potential conflict with vehicles travelling in the opposite direction. Any redesign of the junction would mean the loss of both trees and parking spaces; the road goes past Drummond Community High School; and buses using it as a regular route would likely result in complaints from residents there. Discussions with local councillors found no support for pursuing a Green Street option. The update notes that the number of buses using East London Street in autumn last year was 56 leaving the depot and 37 returning per day, but that the current schedule indicates the figures have come down to 26 and 27. And Lothian Buses believe they have reduced the use of the street \"to the minimum level\". The update adds: \"Lothian Buses are aware of the noise complaints and feel they have done all they can to reduce the impact. Any further reduction would carry a significant cost implication as additional resource of both buses and drivers would need to be added to the network to meet service schedules.\" One option which was previously floated was to tarmac the central carriageway of East London Street while retaining the cobbles or \"setts\" on either side, close to the pavement, a move which would be controversial. But the update says: \"East London Street does not currently feature in the three-year programme of sett renewal schemes. Any decision to remove or overlay existing setts would need to be considered by committee at a time when the noted scheme has been prioritised for capital investment.\" It adds that East London Street will continue to be inspected, with repairs prioritised in line with the timescales set out in council guidance, but no further action is planned for now. Committee convener Stephen Jenkinson said: \u201cWe've looked into this and considered all the various options. Unfortunately this street doesn\u2019t form part of of the three year programme for sett renewal. It may be something that can be tackled further down the line, but in the short term there's no further action proposed.\u201d", "summary": "It looks like the end of the road for efforts to tackle the problem of bus noise disturbing the sleep of residents in a New Town street.", "url": "https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/edinburgh-streets-no-further-action-planned-over-residents-complaints-on-bus-noise-in-east-london-street-5012674", "image": "https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/webimg/b25lY21zOmJiMjFjMGExLTRkODItNDAyZi1iZTBmLTIyMWI5ZjFlMDBlODoxZThiZjNkOC1iNWNhLTRmNGUtODg5Ni05NTE1YzZjN2I2OTM=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 04:45:48", "author": "Ian Swanson", "authors": ["Ian Swanson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.465}, {"id": 295536132, "title": "Kenmore 30 inch Gas Stove", "text": "House-Home / \n Appliances (Major) / \n\n Stoves & Ovens\n\n Kenmore 30 inch Gas Stove\n\n Login to Email Seller \n In excellent condition. \n5 burner, broiler, and oven all natural gas.

The day began on a promising note for Kerala, with Sarwate and Baby adopting a cautious approach against a disciplined Vidarbha attack.\n\nSarwate, who played a crucial knock of 79, was the first to fall when Dubey had him caught by Danish Malewar at short midwicket. The wicket triggered a middle-order collapse as Salman Nizar, Kerala\u2019s most consistent batter this season, was trapped LBW by Dubey for 21 just before the lunch break.\n\nSachin Baby, however, held firm, forging key partnerships to keep Kerala\u2019s innings alive. He added 59 runs with Mohammad Azharuddeen before the latter was dismissed for 34, trapped lbw by Darshan Nalkande. Baby then stitched another valuable stand of 46 runs with Jalaj Saxena, keeping Kerala\u2019s hopes of taking a first-innings lead intact.\n\nJust as Kerala looked set to push past Vidarbha\u2019s total, they suffered a major setback when Baby fell agonizingly short of a century. The Kerala skipper, who had battled hard for 235 balls and struck 10 boundaries in his innings of 98, edged a delivery from Parth Rekhade to Karun Nair at slip. His dismissal derailed Kerala\u2019s progress, and they lost their last four wickets for just 18 runs.\n\nJalaj Saxena contributed a resilient 28, while Eden Apple Tom (10) and Nidheesh (1) failed to provide much lower-order resistance. Kerala\u2019s innings folded at 342, handing Vidarbha a slender but vital lead of 37 runs.\n\nFor Vidarbha, their bowlers put in a collective effort, with Darshan Nalkande, Harsh Dubey, and Parth Rekhade picking up three wickets each, while Yash Thakur chipped in with one. Dubey\u2019s figures of 3/88 not only helped his team gain the upper hand but also solidified his record-breaking season.", "summary": "Vidarbha vs Kerala Ranji Trophy Final Day 4 Live Score: Vidarbha look to extend their lead after bowling Kerala out in 1st innings", "url": "https://www.news18.com/cricket/vidarbha-vs-kerala-live-score-ranji-trophy-final-vid-vs-ker-match-day-4-full-scorecard-sachin-baby-jalaj-saxena-akshay-wadkar-karun-nair-danish-malewar-liveblog-9245378.html", "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/03/Vidarbha-vs-Kerala-Ranji-Trophy-Final-Day-4-Live-Score-2025-03-c1ab4143e70190fa47b6e280acd7af9e-16x9.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 03:24:10", "author": "News18", "authors": ["News18"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.329}, {"id": 295580182, "title": "Champions Trophy: England elect to bat first against South Africa in Buttler\u2019s final game as captain", "text": "Karachi, March 1 (IANS) England have won the toss and elected to bat first against South Africa in the final Group B match of 2025 Champions Trophy at the National Stadium on Saturday.

There's an AMOLED screen on the back which gives you notifications and access to some of the basic functions. \n\nIt comes with Android 14 pre-loaded, running off an 8-core chip with 32gb of DDR ram, and 256gb of storage. \n\nThe camera setup is also impressive. There's a 100mp main camera, a 20mp night-vision mode, it shoots 4K video, and uses AI technology to enhance pictures. \n\nIt supports 5G and WiFi 6, 33w fast charging, and we haven't even got to the best bits yet.\n\nDoogee's USP is phones that can stand up to abuse. And the S200 is built for rough treatment. \n\nIts casing is made from aerospace-grade aluminium which meets military spec MIL-STD-810H certification and there are IP69 and IP69K protection levels from water, humidity, dust and sand.\n\nAnd, let me remind you, this phone can be bought for just \u00a3259.99. Sim free. \n\nTo put that into perspective, the Google Pixel Pro XL is \u00a31,099 at the moment, and the iPhone 16 Pro is \u00a3999. \n\nReality check time, though. It will not outperform a flagship smartphone. The hardware may be impressive on paper, but in use it just isn't as polished. \n\nThe camera, for example is pretty good on the Doogee S200, but a Pixel, iPhone, or Samsung would run rings around it, especially on video performance. \n\nWhile the display is nice and fluid and crisp, a Samsung S25 would put it to shame. \n\nAnd its processor is capable of handling some very strenuous tasks, but you can overwork it with some resource-hungry apps and games that a true flagship would handle. \n\nBut we need to put things into perspective. This isn't a stylish trinket for people who want the latest and best smartphone tech on the market. I'm blown away by how well it performs, but it's a tool, built for people who need a tool. \n\nIt's designed for the sorts of people who'll find the onboard \"ToolBag\" menu useful. Does your iPhone have a \"plumb bob\", for example? No.\n\nLove magazines but hate the cost? With Readly, you can access dozens of top tech titles for one low price \u2013 and right now, you can get two months free. Click here for more information.\n\nDoes your Pixel have a protractor or a \"gradienter\"? I don't know what that is, but I know mine doesn't. \n\nThe Doogee S200's one-click shortcuts even have an option to start the underwater camera - that's how practical and robust this thing its. \n\nIt is, however, unashamedly bulky. It feels like a conventional smartphone in an extremely hefty case. But it's heavier. If you're used to an iPhone XS, it'll shock you. \n\nI found the built-in speakers a bit tinny, and I wish it had wireless charging but its futuristic, almost sci-fi design is so appropriate for its USP, and it'll be the perfect companion for people who work on dirty building sites for a living. \n\nIf you like a dainty little phone that you can slip in a pocket or a bag, look away now. This isn't for you.\n\nBut if you like the great outdoors, if you work in an environment that kills phones quickly, or even if you\u2019re just especially clumsy, this is perfect. \n\nAnd I'm sorry to keep going on about this, but it really is an absolute bargain.", "summary": "The Doogee S200 is tough enough to meet military test standards - consumer technology writer Gareth Butterfield gives his verdict", "url": "https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/recommended/this-rugged-dual-screen-smartphone-is-an-amazing-price-right-now-weve-tested-it-5010774", "image": "https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/jpim-static/image/2025/02/27/15/49/DSC00642.jpeg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75&crop=3:2,smart&trim=", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 08:00:31", "author": "Gareth Butterfield", "authors": ["Gareth Butterfield"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.237}, {"id": 295580174, "title": "Former Newcastle and Crystal Palace star talks stunning Hibs fan reactions as Gayle targets more derby glory", "text": "Dwight Gayle has always understood the power of goals. His entire career, up to and including impressive campaigns in the Premier League, has been built on netting big winners and crucial equalisers when it mattered most. But the former Newcastle and Crystal Palace forward seemed to have been genuinely surprised by the impact of his beautifully-timed strike to secure Hibs victory over local rivals Hearts at Tynecastle the last time these teams meet. The thrill of that brilliantly barmy Boxing Day moment, and the celebrations that followed, were just the start. Gayle, who has since grown used to Hibs fans approaching him to share their memories of that day, revealed: \u201cPeople say that obviously they love the fact that you were able to give them such a special moment. People stop you in the street and they sort of let you know where they were, what they did in their front rooms and at the pub and stuff like that. Or how they were able to get bragging rights over friends and stuff. \u201cSo it just shows you what it means to a lot of people. It just shows you how much people appreciate it really. \u201cI just remember Tynecastle, I just remember having goosebumps. Like this doesn't happen too often. Being able to be a part of something like that, you just forget that sometimes as a player \u201cWhen you start coming towards the end you almost start to realise that it's not going to be happening too many more times. So it makes you appreciate it a bit more. \u201cEven Dundee United away the other day, being able to celebrate with the fans and staff, those are special moments. Junior coming on with the goal at the end, it's just nice to be part of that great vibe.\u201d When it was pointed out that Gayle, who set up fellow substitute Junior Hoilett for the third goal in Wednesday night\u2019s 3-1 win, had shown a fair turn of pace as he ran towards the Shed end of Tannadice to join in the celebrations at full-time, the 35-year-old smiled as he admitted: \u201cYeah, I don't think I would have been able to do that too many more times to be fair! But no, it was a great moment for us - and you see what it means to the group.\u201d With retirement all but certainly beckoning at the end of this season, Gayle has a few ambitions left to fulfil. Lifting some silverware with Hibs would be ideal, of course. Beyond that, though, he\u2019s in the market for memories. Experiences that he\u2019ll carry with him once the boots have finally been hung up. Scoring against Hearts was pretty sweet. So, too, being part of a Hibs side serenaded with an emotional rendition of Sunshine on Leith following last weekend\u2019s Easter Road win over Celtic. That rather whetted his appetite for the prospect of winning an Edinburgh derby in front of a home support in tomorrow\u2019s lunchtime kick-off, Gayle admitting: \u201cYeah, I mean, some of the video clips and stuff are very special. A lot of my friends came up to the Celtic game and just said they haven't experienced something like that. I include myself in that. \u201cIt was a really nice moment to sing the song with the fans and to be able to put on such a performance on Saturday for the fans was fantastic. I'd really like to experience it again this weekend. \u201cYou can see what it means to the boys at the moment, being able to celebrate with the fans. It's just a really nice bond at the moment.\u201d Speaking last week, young midfielder Nathan Moriah-Welsh became the latest in a long line of Hibs players to talk in glowing terms about the influence Gayle is having on their progression through the professional ranks. It seems like only yesterday, the veteran admits, when he was the wide-eyed kid soaking up knowledge from a couple of old boys at Palace. \u201cYeah, I didn't know that to be fair,\u201d said Gayle, when told about his team-mate\u2019s words of praise. \u201cI hadn't heard that - but that's really nice to hear. \u201cObviously, getting to be one of the older players now, it is my job to be one of the spokespeople to help people when they're not in the team and stuff. I feel like I was helpful with people like Rocky Bushiri and Jack Iredale who weren't in the side at the beginning of the season - but they're great professionals in terms of application and training and waiting for their chance. Obviously, they proved their worth by what they've been able to do recently, and Nathan as well. GET THE LATEST HIBS NEWS DIRECTLY TO YOUR EMAIL INBOX WITH OUR FREE NEWSLETTER SERVICE \u201cMe and Nathan get on really well and I've been trying to mould him into being the best he can. He's an unbelievable player and he's got a great understanding of the game. He's obviously had a good upbringing in that case and he's showing now with his two performances so far and hopefully he continues it. \u201cIn terms of people that looked after me, I think of people like Jason Puncheon and Scott Dann, some of the older pros at Crystal Palace. There was a great dressing room where I come into it very immature in the whole professional gam; I felt like that was the great dressing room for me to come into in terms of moulding me into a correct pro and a good player. \u201cObviously I always say to the boys to enjoy it for what it is because it flies by. It definitely does.\u201d Your next Hibs read - Gray\u2019s men \u2018getting away with one\u2019 is proof of a team making own luck", "summary": "Premier League veteran admits to \u2018goosebumps\u2019 moment at Tynecastle ahead of Easter Road clash", "url": "https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/sport/football/hibs/ex-newcastle-crystal-palace-veteran-gayle-hibs-fan-interactions-edinburgh-derby-importance-gorgie-glory-5012728", "image": "https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/jpim-static/image/2025/02/28/17/29/21315570.jpeg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 08:00:44", "author": "John Greechan", "authors": ["John Greechan"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.214}, {"id": 295500538, "title": "Trump Cabinet Marco Rubio Reacts On Zelenskyy And Trump Face Off At The White House | News18", "text": "Afghanistan\n\nAmitabh Bachchan\n\nSea Gliders\n\nVicky Kaushal\n\nTCS Employee\n\nChampions Trophy\n\nReel Awards\n\nTrump Cabinet Marco Rubio Reacts On Zelenskyy And Trump Face Off At The White House | News18\n\nTrump Cabinet Marco Rubio Reacts On Zelenskyy And Trump Face Off At The White House | News18\n\nLast Updated:March 01, 2025, 08:43 IST India World\n\nFirst Trump Cabinet Member Marco Rubio Reacts On Zelenskyy And Trump Face off At The White House n18oc_worldNews18 Mobile App - https://onelink.to/desc-youtube\n\nMore from world\n\nJd Vance Blasts Ukraine President Zelenskyy | Trump Zelensky Meeting | Russia Ukraine War | N18G\n\n'Just 767 IDF Troops For 5000...'

But the recent release of updated Environment Agency maps, which included climate projections, show just how severe the situation is becoming. By the middle of this century a shocking one in four properties in England could be at risk of flooding. Between 2040 and 2060, up to 6.1 million properties could be affected by surface water flooding, and 3.1 million homes will be vulnerable to river and coastal flooding, with many experiencing water depths exceeding 30cm.

Coastal erosion: no safety net For people living by the coast, many of whom are retirees, life has become a living nightmare as rising sea levels threaten thousands of properties and the ground below communities literally erodes, and homes tumble into the sea. Unlike flood damage, which has some insurance coverage, homeowners facing coastal erosion have no financial safety net. The national coastal erosion risk map (NCERM) estimates that 5,200 properties will be lost to the sea by 2055, increasing to 19,700 by 2105. Visit https://environment.data.gov.uk/dataset/9fede91f-5acd-4fd2-9bd8-98153fa3c2ff website. This assumes all Shoreline Management Plans (SMPs) are implemented. But given the UK\u2019s current economic limitations, it\u2019s unlikely that all protective measures will be funded. And if SMPs are not put in place, the number of homes at risk could increase nine-fold. There are an increasing number of UK climate refugees \u2013 residents forced to abandon their homes because of natural disasters and environmental changes. Flooding and extreme weather events are no longer rare occurrences but are increasing realities. With all these problems bearing down on us, it\u2019s vital that developers, planners and surveyors \u2013 whose job it is to value land and buildings and provide expert advice on construction \u2013 include climate considerations to future proof properties. Relying on outdated information results in financial losses, uninsurable homes, and unfortunately even loss of life. But there are measures to limit future harm during retrofits or new build. Solutions for the future Buildings account for 39 per cent of global energy-related carbon emissions, and the construction sector is one of the most wasteful, typically reusing just one per cent of demolition materials. Using sustainable building methods is vital and integrating features like green roofs, elevated floors, and proper flood-ready drainage will become more important. Low-carbon construction, promote resilient building materials, and advocate for climate-conscious planning. The UK experienced record-breaking heat in 2024, with temperatures reaching over 40\u00b0C. Traditional cooling methods like air conditioning are energy intensive. Instead, shading, and passive cooling can keep homes comfortable and reduce energy use and therefore electricity bills.

Wildfires, which were once rare in the UK, have increased dramatically, with 24,000 recorded in 2022 \u2013 four times the previous year\u2019s figure \u2013 so fire safety in building design is crucial. The built environment needs to adapt swiftly, and sound advice is vital in driving this by incorporating strategies into every aspect of building design and construction to keep people safe for the extreme weather events that are becoming more common. The role of property professionals and data in defending our homes from the effects of climate change has never been more critical.

Green Swap Instead of factory-baked bread wrapped in unrecyclable plastic, buy loaves that are freshly baked in the supermarket, and carry them home in a tote bag. You\u2019ll be eating delicious bread and reducing your carbon footprint too. How people can help to green their communities Reducing the carbon footprint of your neighbourhood is much easier when everyone works together. With teamwork, we can all make the communities where we live healthier and more sustainable places \u2013 now, and for future generations. The key is getting a core group of people involved to start with. It might take a bit of organisation to get the ball rolling, but you could start a local social media group, a WhatsApp group, or hold a meeting to brainstorm ideas with your neighbours. The more people who get involved, the more of an impact on your community you can make. Spruce up your home with plants One of the easiest ways to make your community greener is by encouraging everyone to plant plants and flowers in their homes. Whether it\u2019s a front or back garden, a balcony, or even just a window box, adding some greenery can make a big difference to the ecological diversity of the area. Planting some bee-friendly flowers or growing herbs to share with your neighbours is a start, and potted plants on doorsteps can help brighten up the street. Start a community garden If you live in an area that\u2019s short on open space, a community garden is a great way to bring neighbours together to improve local biodiversity. Team up with some other residents to turn an unused plot of land into a shared garden which will provide fresh fruit, veg or flowers. Group gardening is a lot of fun and it\u2019s a great way to meet new people. Plant some trees Trees improve air quality, provide shade in summer and help fight climate change. Join your local council or an environmental group like the Woodland Trust to organise a tree-planting event in your area. Schools, parks, and disused land are all great places to add more greenery and improve the local environment. Leave the car at home Encouraging your neighbours to walk, cycle, or take public transport instead of driving helps to cut down on local pollution and traffic congestion. Try setting up a local car-sharing scheme or organising a walk to school day for families in the area. Not only does this help the environment, but it\u2019s also a great way to build stronger ties with your neighbours. Recycle and reduce waste together Recycling is great but reducing waste is even better. Try setting up a neighbourhood swap shop for books, toys, clothes and household items.

The government regulates these prices through mechanisms like excise taxes, base pricing, and price caps.\nFactors Influencing Petrol and Diesel Prices in India\n\nCrude Oil Prices: As the key raw material for producing petrol and diesel, fluctuations in global crude oil prices have a direct impact on fuel costs in India.\nExchange Rate: India imports a significant portion of its crude oil, so changes in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the US dollar influence fuel prices. A weaker rupee generally leads to higher fuel costs.\nTaxes: Petrol and diesel prices are subject to various taxes imposed by both the central and state governments. These taxes can vary from state to state, contributing significantly to the final price consumers pay at the pump.\nRefining Costs: The process of refining crude oil into petrol and diesel incurs costs that influence fuel prices. These expenses can vary based on factors such as the type of crude oil processed and the efficiency of the refinery.\nDemand: The balance of supply and demand plays a crucial role in determining fuel prices. Increased demand for petrol and diesel typically results in higher prices, as suppliers adjust to market conditions.\n\nCheck Petrol and Diesel Prices via SMS\nYou can easily check the latest petrol and diesel prices in your city through SMS.

The veteran keeper is preparing for another derby clash in his long and illustrious career, Neil Critchley\u2019s men currently thriving in a run of form that\u2019s shot them in European football contention. They have found solidity in central defence with winter signings Jamie McCart and Michael Steinwender hitting the ground running. Both have proven solid in defence and proven an attacking outlet when needed as they look to derail a Hibs team this weekend who are yet to lose this calendar year. Amid injuries to the likes of Craig Halkett, Frankie Kent and Stephen Kingsley, Gordon is full of praise for McCart and Steinwender. Gordon explained ahead of the Premiership battle in Leith: \u201cReally good because that's an area of the pitch you don't really want to change. We've been forced to change that quite a lot this season. A lot of defensive changes through injuries and they've gelled together really well in such a short space of time. \u201cIt's not an easy thing to do but really pleased with the way things have been going with the two of them. They've got a real appetite to keep the ball out the back of the net which is great to play behind. You want to try and keep the defence as settled as possible in any team. It's not ideal to have that chopping and changing from week to week but I think overall we've managed to deal with that. \u201cWe've had a number of different players playing at centre-half throughout the season. The two guys mentioned are the ones that are in position at the moment and starting to form a decent partnership. Long may that continue that we have a settled partnership in that area of the pitch. \u201cYou can't legislate for everything that's going to happen in a game. There are a few pointers in training that will come up very early on in the first few training sessions before we even get to play a match. There is a little bit of chat but it's just getting the feel in different situations for what each other is likely to do and where we expect each other's positions to be. That only comes with playing matches.\u201d Another who has shone since signing is Elton Kabangu. He has provided a focal point in attack Gordon has been happy to see his team have, explaining: \u201cHe's been fantastic for us. He's brought goals to the team. He's brought a lot of energy both on the pitch and off it, even to the training sessions. \u201cHe's been a massive reason why things have been going well of late. He's really galvanised everybody, to have somebody of that quality playing at that end of the pitch for us. It's been fantastic and it's brought the best out of other players on the pitch as well. It's fantastic to have him here. Let's hope he can enjoy the derby as well.\u201d Gordon has had brilliant highs and sobering lows in derby battle, so he knows all about what clashes with Hibs can bring. He believes the current Gorgie dressing room has the right blend of experience to cope with the challenges that are ahead. The keeper added: \u201cWe've got a good mix in our squad. Good, experienced players and also ones that have played many derbies before and not just the Edinburgh derby. \u201cWe do have a good mix and because we're playing well and things are going good for us at the moment, I don't see that being a problem going into this game. Certainly as one of the more experienced players, to put it lightly, it's fine to be in that dressing room and be able to be calm and lead by example.

The country already has international recognition for its dark sky areas like Eryri which are now a tourism driver. \n\nBut the government wants to go further - making recommendations to reduce night time lighting across the nation. They said it can help improve life for wildlife and people, as well as reduce costs and carbon emissions. \n\nIt adds that it needs to be done in a way that does not impact public safety. There would be different expectations based on the nature of each area - particularly between urban and rural parts of the nation. \n\nA guidance document on the Conservation and Enhancement of Dark Skies in Wales says: \"Dark skies are an important natural resource for Wales, its people, and future generations. More than two-thirds of Wales has a dark sky, parts are internationally recognised as Dark Sky Reserves, Dark Sky Park, Dark Sky Sanctuary and as a Dark Sky Community. Yet there is much more to be done to get lighting at night right in communities where people live, and for nature.\n\n\"Light pollution is caused by artificial light at night(ALAN) in areas where it is not wanted, is excessive or inappropriate to context. Although awareness of the opportunities of a night sky and of light pollution and its effects are becoming more apparent, light pollution remains a problem across much of Wales. Light pollution wastes money by costing to light where it is not needed.\n\n\"The purpose of this guidance is to increase understanding of how to conserve and enhance dark skies in Wales through planning and design to make a tangible difference. The guidance does not mean no lights, but only where light is needed.\n\n\"Good lighting practice should be followed using the right light in the right place, at the right time. This Welsh Government guidance supports national and local planning policies on dark skies and light pollution. It provides an opportunity to promote a national approach and should be followed by all those involved in the planning, design and determination of planning applications or lighting schemes.\"\n\nSummary of the basic principles: \n\n Don\u2019t light unless it\u2019s necessary. Light only where needs to be lit, avoiding over-lighting and clutter. Light should be no brighter than necessary. Use warm colour temperatures;2,700K or lower. Use switch-off, dimming or PIR sensors. Use a lower mounting height where possible. Limit internal lighting spilling outside target area. Keep light away from wildlife \n\nTwo landscape scale visualisations, depicting \u2018before\u2019 and \u2018after\u2019 dark sky friendly actions have been created to show how this could work in practice. The \u2018before\u2019 visualisation identifies contributors to light pollution in communities and landscapes and the \u2018after\u2019 visualisation shows what our communities and landscapes could look like, and benefit from, when action is taken to reduce light pollution.

Overly bright unshielded light, glare extending beyond area required. Light intrusion in rural landscapes and wildlife habitats. Security light glare. \n\nBlinds on roof lights or low Visible Light Transmission (VLT) glazing. Lighting is directed downwards to illuminate only the sports area. Shielded programmable lights on sensors directed downwards to task areas. No unnecessary light intrusion in the landscape. Directed security lights with proximity sensors. Minimising artificial light along river corridor and floodplain for wildlife. \n\nThe guidance spells out why the government thinks it is important. It states: \"All living things adjust their behaviour according to natural light, artificial light can alter the natural patterns of light and dark. The invention of artificial light has done much to safeguard and enhance the night time environment but, if not properly controlled, obtrusive light pollution can have serious, adverse effects on ecosystems, landscapes and on people\u2019s physical and mental health. \n\n\"Switching to energy efficient dark sky lighting, and switching off when it is not needed, has the potential to save energy, money and reduce carbon emissions in Wales.\"\n\nIt adds: \"Local Development Plans should contain policies that seek to balance the need for lighting for safety and security whilst limiting the impact of light pollution from artificial light on people, wildlife and dark skies/landscape, reducing carbon emissions and increasing energy efficiency.\"\n\nRebecca Evans, Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Energy and Planning, said: \"My expectation is that this guidance will be used across Wales by all those involved in the planning system, with the aim of letting people experience the wonder of the natural night sky and allowing ecosystems to function naturally by avoiding and removing light pollution across the country. \n\n\"A dark sky approach does not mean the use of no lights, but using better, dark sky friendly lights. Whatever our role and however big or small our development, our responsibility to ourselves and our future generations is to contribute positively to the well-being of Wales \u2013this includes planning for dark skies.\"", "summary": "The government has sent out guidance to planners on light pollution", "url": "https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/night-time-could-darker-wales-31101380", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailypost.co.uk/incoming/article31102095.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_dpw280225dark_02.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 05:07:00", "author": "Owen Hughes", "authors": ["Owen Hughes"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.082}, {"id": 295526302, "title": "Toilet charges introduced at Llandudno paddling pool with 'yellow' water warning", "text": "Toilet charges have started at council run toilets next to the paddling pool on Llandudno seafront.

Those additional tests revealed the trochlea injury.\n\nAs Beede explains, the trochlea is \u201ca groove in the lower end of the femur that guides the kneecap during knee movements.\u201d When it\u2019s damaged, it can cause pain, instability and additional knee issues.\n\nAccording to the team, a treatment plan is still being developed for Suggs, but the expectation is that he\u2019ll make a full recovery.\n\nSuggs has now missed 24 of the Magic\u2019s past 25 games after also sitting out for 10 consecutive contests in January due to a lower-back strain. He has been limited to just 35 total outings this season and had averaged 16.2 points, 4.0 rebounds and 3.7 assists in 28.6 minutes per game, with a shooting line of .410/.314/.882.\n\nAlthough Suggs\u2019 shooting numbers are underwhelming, the Magic have clearly missed having him in the backcourt. Besides being one of the team\u2019s offensive engines, the 23-year-old is a major part of Orlando\u2019s defense. He earned a spot on the All-Defensive second team last season, but won\u2019t get a chance to repeat that feat this season, since he\u2019ll fall short of the required 65-game minimum.\n\nThe Magic are 20-15 in games Suggs has played this season and just 9-17 without him. The club, which held a top-four spot in the East for most of the season through mid-January, has fallen to 29-32 as a result of its recent swoon and currently ranks seventh in the conference, which is in play-in territory.\n\nOrlando is typically pretty vague about injury recovery timelines, so it may be a little while before we get a clear sense of when Suggs could return. He signed a five-year, $150M rookie-scale extension with the team last fall that will go into effect in 2025-26, so it\u2019s safe to assume the Magic will take a cautious approach to his recovery process.", "summary": "He has been limited to just 35 total outings this season.", "url": "https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/magic_star_out_indefinitely_with_knee_injury/s1_14822_41835583", "image": "https://www.yardbarker.com/media/5/a/5a90cb4d94b732800dd05e4dabb8a14376184041/thumb_16x9/magic-star-out-indefinitely-knee-injury.jpg?v=1", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 04:36:06", "author": "Hoops Rumors,Luke Adams", "authors": ["Hoops Rumors", "Luke Adams"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.349}, {"id": 295553390, "title": "Wild cocoa markets push Europe\u2019s historic chocolatiers to the brink", "text": "Paris\u2019s oldest chocolate shop has occupied a street corner in the ninth arrondissement since 1761. Ownership of \u00c0 la M\u00e8re de Famille has changed hands from family to family over the centuries, but it has endured through occupation and revolution thanks to the Parisian appetite for confectionery. The store\u2019s current owners, the Dolfi family, took it over in 2000 and now sell more than 150 varieties, from nougat to pralines to marzipan, from 16 outlets across the French capital. \u201cThis is 100% a family business,\u201d said Steve Dolfi, one of the four siblings who run the chocolatier. \u201cWe produce 100% of everything we\u2019re selling.\u201dBut the Dolfis have watched as many of their peers have gone out of business. Government records show that at least a dozen family-owned chocolatiers have closed down across Europe over the past year \u2014 casualties of a fourth straight season of tight cocoa supplies, which have driven up prices and squeezed margins across the industry. Larger companies, such as Nestle SA, Lindt & Spruengli AG and Hershey Co., have all taken hits to their share prices, but their scale has enabled them to ride out the disruptions to the market. Smaller artisanal companies have been faced with difficult calculations around what they can charge their customers. \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky game,\u201d Steve\u2019s brother Jonathan said. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t increase our prices the company will lose money, we will have to lay people off and we\u2019re going to be in trouble. But if the increase is too much, it\u2019s a risk. We are walking on eggshells.\u201dEurope is responsible for about half of global cocoa bean imports, which help fuel its $50 billion chocolate market. Switzerland and Germany consume more than 20 pounds (9.1 kilograms) of chocolate per person per year. Most of that is imported from West Africa, where harsh weather and virulent crop diseases have hit harvests hard.In the 2023-24 season, the market experienced a supply deficit of 478,000 metric tons, the largest shortfall since at least the 1980s, according to estimates from the International Cocoa Association. That spurred cocoa prices to nearly triple last year, surging to just shy of $13,000 a ton, putting enormous pressure on some of the biggest chocolate and food makers. Swiss giant Nestle has passed some of the higher costs on to consumers, but has also had to take mitigating measures, such as adding a higher proportion of biscuits or wafers to some products to lower the amount of cocoa needed.\u201cThe impact of rising costs is being felt across the industry,\u201d Muriel Korter, director general of the Association of Chocolate, Biscuit and Confectionery Industries of Europe said. \u201cHowever, smaller businesses, which often have fewer resources to absorb these price increases, have had to adapt quickly.\u201dSome have simply folded. German confectioner Leysieffer produced one of the country\u2019s most popular chocolate pralines for more than a century. The company liquidated in November having previously filed for insolvency in 2022, citing sharp hikes in raw material and energy costs. Weeks earlier, Salzburg Schokolade in Austria, who have been in operation since the late 19th century, closed up its factory that once produced 57 million of its iconic Mozart-inspired chocolates annually.Rising prices have forced smaller confectioners to make the same challenging decision as the Dolfis, who have raised their prices by 8%.Austrian chocolatier Franz Hauswirth declared bankruptcy in November of last year after the surge in prices forced the maker of popular Easter bunnies to raise prices. That resulted in \u201cdemand destruction,\u201d according to Roman Hauswirth, managing director at the company and a third-generation chocolatier.This is a pressing concern for smaller companies, as higher prices may force consumers to switch from more expensive independent retailers to bigger mass-market ones. Hershey and Mondelez International Inc., two of the biggest bulk chocolate producers, said last week at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference that consumers will need to adjust to a new normal where chocolate is 40-50% more costly than it used to be.\u201cConsumers will shift from buying more expensive to cheaper chocolates,\u201d Steve Wateridge, head of research at market analysis firm Tropical Research Services, said. \u201cSome people are closing down because they can\u2019t afford it and the market is competitive. It\u2019s really on a knife edge at the moment.\u201dData on cocoa grinds \u2013 where cocoa is turned into butter and powder to use in confectioneries \u2013 revealed that bean processing in Europe was the lowest since 2020 during the fourth quarter of last year, suggesting that global consumption might be dropping in response to record-high prices.Larger companies are trying to reduce their costs by finding alternative ingredients, such as replacing cocoa butter with shea butter-based equivalents or substituting in sunflower or palm oil to cut costs. But artisan producers are reluctant to change their recipes.Some are trying to find alternative sources, diversifying away from Ivory Coast and Ghana, where the supply shortages are most acute, and toward areas in Central and South America which are seeing their share of global cocoa production steadily increasing. In Bruges, Belgium, a country famed for its chocolate, Chocolatier Dumon has operated since the 1990s, serving traditional pralines to tourists visiting the medieval city center. The company produces roughly 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) of chocolates per week.\u201cLike most of our colleagues in the past few years, we have been refocusing more toward South America. Mexico and Colombia have become very important for us,\u201d Jelle Descamps, Dumon\u2019s owner, explained. \u201cThe crops in Africa have felt the effects of climate change more.\u201dA busy Christmas period reassured Descamps that, at least for now, demand for Dumon\u2019s chocolate hasn\u2019t fallen significantly. \u201cWe are covered for the moment but of course, if cocoa continues at this level, we will have to cover ourselves again at even higher prices,\u201d Descamps said. \u201cThat\u2019s a scary thought.\u201dFor chocolatiers looking to the market for a signal of what\u2019s to come, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co foresee a smaller than anticipated supply shortfall for the current season, trimming their deficit estimates from 108,000 to 40,000 tons, largely due to high prices denting demand.The likelihood of longer-term respite in prices however will rely on a degree of demand destruction, coupled with improved crop conditions in West Africa, Wateridge said. \u201cWhen we look forward to 2025-26, as long as we haven\u2019t underestimated the decline in production in Ivory Coast and Ghana and if demand falls further, we will generate a decent sized surplus.\u201dEven if supplies ease in the longer term, small chocolate producers have a tough year ahead of them. In Paris, the Dolfi family worry about what is lost when longstanding family businesses vanish. \u201cWhat\u2019s sad in these cases is that recipes and skills are disappearing,\u201d the Dolfi brothers said in an email. \u201cThere are a lot of traditions that are passed on by word of mouth.\u201dWith prices still high, the Dolfi family worries about next Christmas, traditionally the most important time of the year for confectioners in Europe. By then, they forecast that chocolate consumers could be grappling with the highest prices in history. The family\u2019s approach to survival between now and then, the brothers said, is like that of many of their peers: \u201cWait and pray.\u201d", "summary": "This issue has forced many smaller chocolatiers to close, while larger companies mitigate through cost-cutting measures.", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/trade/exports/insights/wild-cocoa-markets-push-europes-historic-chocolatiers-to-the-brink/articleshow/118641791.cms", "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-118641806,resizemode-4,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-163650,overlay-etrise/articleshow.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 04:41:45", "author": "Bloomberg", "authors": ["Bloomberg"], "language": "en", "category": "sports", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.209}, {"id": 295553386, "title": "eInfochips joins Samsung Advanced Foundry Ecosystem to drive semiconductor innovation", "text": "eInfochips, an Arrow Electronics company, announced that the company has joined the Samsung Advanced Foundry Ecosystem (SAFE\u2122) as a Virtual Design Partner.eInfochips is a leading provider of digital transformation and product engineering services.

Most parts of the country are likely to see more days of heat waves than usual during the three months ending on May 31, D.S. Pai, additional director general of the India Meteorological Department, said at a briefing on Friday.An early onset of summer has already stoked concerns about the wheat crop in the second-biggest grower of the grain. In 2022, the hottest March in more than 100 years hit production and forced the government to curb exports. Rising temperatures will also boost consumption of coal by power plants to avoid blackouts in the country.The average maximum temperatures across the nation rose to 29.07C (84.33F) in February, the second highest for the month since at least 1901, according to the weather office. Temperatures in March \u2014 crucial for wheat plants that are at a vulnerable stage \u2014 may be above normal in most parts of India, it said.Any damage to wheat plants in India may undermine the government\u2019s efforts to temper food prices, and possibly lead to a 40% import duty being reduced or scrapped. Despite record production last year, local stockpiles are near the lowest in 16 years, according to the US Department of Agriculture.Extreme weather conditions may also put pressure on the power system in the world\u2019s most populous nation, which is gearing up for a record peak electricity demand of 270 gigawatts this summer, a rise of 8% from last year. Coal inventories at power plants touched an all-time high on Thursday, as producers stockpiled the fuel for the coming summer. Still, the nation remains vulnerable to blackouts during evenings when solar power generation stops.While the focus is on keeping the power generation fleet ready, extreme heat is posing a grave threat to the grid as well. Last summer, India saw a series of transformer fires mostly because of excessive use of air-conditioners to beat high temperatures.Northern parts of the country, where majority of wheat is grown, are also forecast to receive normal rains in March, the weather department said. Above-average precipitation is expected over parts of peninsular and central regions, it said.

If Pitt does not win this high-value game against Louisville, Pitt\u2019s fate would be sealed for certain. The Panthers would need to win the ACC Tournament to make the NCAA Tournament, the way NC State did a year ago. This game is basically Pitt\u2019s season.\nHere are the Pitt-Louisville College Basketball Odds, courtesy of FanDuel \nCollege Basketball Odds: Pitt-Louisville Odds\nPitt: +10.5 (-110)\nMoneyline: +430\nLouisville: -10.5 (-110)\nMoneyline: -600\nOver: 150.5 (-115)\nUnder: 150.5 (-105)\nHow to Watch Pitt vs Louisville\nTime: 6 p.m. ET/3 p.m. PT\n\n*Watch college basketball LIVE with fuboTV (Get Access | Save $30)*\nWhy Pitt Will Cover The Spread/Win\nThe Panthers are playing for their season. Motivation and incentive don\u2019t get much bigger than that. This team was in a very good position for the NCAA Tournament in the middle of January. Then it fell off the rails in the next several weeks. This team did, at one time, play good basketball this season. This team has some talent and has shown what is possible when it plays well. This team can rally around the flag and deliver a big-time performance when it really needs one.\nKeep in mind here that the spread is a double-digit number. A Pitt team needing to save its season could lose by 10 points and still cover the spread. Pitt\u2019s job is to try to win this game \u2014 the Panthers won\u2019t make the NCAA Tournament if they lose \u2014 but if they merely keep it close, they will cover. We have seen a number of double-digit underdogs cover this season, most recently Rutgers against Michigan on Thursday night. Pitt could be the latest example.\nWhy Louisville Will Cover The Spread/Win\nPitt is in freefall. The Panthers have come unglued at the worst possible time. They aren\u2019t just losing; they are losing to below-average teams in a weak ACC. Pitt has been losing bubble games it urgently needed to win. There\u2019s no reason to think Pitt will suddenly turn things around against a Louisville team which has overachieved this season and has been putting away the lower-tier teams in the ACC. Louisville has earned the benefit of the doubt, whereas Pitt has certainly not.\nFinal Pitt-Louisville Prediction & Pick\nPitt has a strong incentive to win, but Louisville is the better, more dependable team. That creates a strong conflict of betting arguments. Therefore, we think you should avoid a pregame bet and should consider a live play based on how much of a fight Pitt mounts early in the game.\nFinal Pitt-Louisville Prediction & Pick: Pitt +10.5", "summary": "It&#8217;s time to continue our College Basketball odds series with a Pitt-Louisville prediction and pick.

To get there, we\u2019re asked to cast our minds back over 45 years to the original 1979 anime\u2014and in doing so, we\u2019re also asked to consider a pretty hilarious idea.\n\nThe vast majority of Gundam GQuuuuuuX\u2014as covered in its prequel/compilation movie GQuuuuuuX Beginning, out in American theaters today for a limited run\u2014is predicated around the fact that the show is in fact set in an alternate version of Gundam\u2018s \u201cUniversal Century\u201d timeline. The primary timeline of the original Gundam and its direct successor series, among others in the franchise, GQuuuuuuX\u2018s version of events asks us to consider another outcome. What if the antagonistic forces of the original series, the secessionist space colony Zeon, actually managed to win the war against Earth?\n\nGQuuuuuuX\u2018s inflection point to show this new timeline takes audiences right back to the very first episode of the 1979 anime. Beginning opens with an almost shot for shot, beat for beat recreation of the original opening moments of Gundam itself: after a brief explanation of the outbreak of the \u201cOne Year War\u201d between Zeon and the Earth Federation, we follow three Zeon mobile suits as they infiltrate the Side 7 colony, looking to gain intel that the Federation has been developing a new prototype mobile suit there.\n\nBut things immediately differ there: we\u2019re told that one of the pilots who was meant to go on the mission is having their Zaku repaired after sustaining damage in a prior mission, leaving Zeon ace pilot Char Aznable to take his place. It\u2019s this that changes everything for GQuuuuuuX\u2018s timeline: Char identifies the prototype mobile suit, the Gundam, makes a bold move to exit his own Zaku and steal it during the chaos of Zeon\u2019s arrival in Side 7, and the rest from there, as they say, is alternate history.\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating to watch unfold in Beginning if you\u2019re a Gundam fan, seeing how the opening half that retells the original Gundam differs from this change, and what things echo throughout both. But if you are a diehard fan of the 1979 classic already, then you probably know who was meant to go on this mission instead of Char, and why it fails in the original series as young Amuro Ray finds himself as the one who gets in the Gundam\u2019s cockpit to fight off the Zeon attackers. A man who is only ever known as Gene.\n\nIn the very first episode of the original Gundam, Gene is kind of a massive asshole. Despite being on a stealth recon mission, he\u2019s loud and brash, high on not only his own supply, but that of his senior officer, Char Aznable, at this point in the conflict a decorated war hero. Bored with simply sitting in his ginormous weapon of war in a colony that, for the most part, just happens to be an ordinary residential facility, Gene immediately grows impatient, moves out of position, and defies orders and a threat of court martial, and starts indiscriminately firing at the Federation facilities and residential areas alike.\n\nIt is this single action, GQuuuuuuX argues, that makes all of Gundam as we know it happen. Without Gene blowing the recon mission\u2014without him yearning to chase the glory Char has had\u2014Amuro never gets in the Gundam, never kills Gene and the other Zeon soldiers attacking the colony, never escapes on the White Base and kicking off a new turnaround in the war for the Earth Federation. Mobile Suit Gundam happens because one egotistical jerk pulls a trigger, envious of the glory achieved by those above him. Of Char, specifically.\n\nAnd that is what makes this both absolutely hilarious, but also completely fascinating at the same time. Because in the original show Char isn\u2019t really the dashing war hero that Gene desperately wished to emulate. He\u2019s a top pilot, yes, but he\u2019s far from the image of a warrior boldly dashing into fights head on: he schemes, he plots, he revels in deception and subterfuge. The war hero is a mask that Char wears as readily as his legendary helmet, always thinking two steps ahead as he plots his own agenda against Zeon\u2019s ruling Zabi family. Char doesn\u2019t care about the war effort: he cares about betraying and destroying the Zabis, and he\u2019ll use the opportunity of becoming their military poster child to do exactly that.\n\nIt\u2019s still the same in GQuuuuuuX\u2018s vision for the character, too. Even with getting access to the Gundam, Char is still playing the war for his own game, plotting his vendetta against the Zabis all the time he is using the Gundam to win the war for them. Hell, even the way he decides to take the Gundam isn\u2019t in the heroically combative manner Gene might have assumed of him: he spots a chance while the Gundam\u2019s inoperative, stages a distraction, and sneakily leaps out of his own suit to run over and take it off the back of a transport vehicle. That is who Char is, regardless of whether or not it\u2019s the man we first met in the 1979 anime, or the version of him we now get to see in GQuuuuuuX\u2018s alternate timeline. What Gene believes in, in presumably both timelines, is predicated on a lie.\n\nAll of this is made upon Char\u2019s layers of intrigue and deception being believed by those around him\u2013whether it\u2019s him successfully managing to eradicate most of the Zabis at the cost of losing the war in the original show, or this new vision of reality we now have in GQuuuuuuX. It\u2019s what makes Beginning such a delectable treat to watch unfold as a long-time fan of the series. It\u2019s made with a clear love and respect for what the original show did as pioneer for the mecha genre in anime, and a keen understanding of what made it so compelling four-and-a-half decades ago in the first place. A respect that\u2019s both enough for it to make such an absurdly fannish gesture in the first place, but also still have it be more than just simple emulation and homage to what came before it.\n\nIf that\u2019s something that GQuuuuuuX can keep at its core as the story progresses into the TV anime at large, Gundam fans will be in for one hell of a treat.\n\nWant more io9 news?

The wheat will be procured at Rs 2,600 per quintal across its 4,000 procurement centres. Farmers are now expected to bring their harvest to the centres on March 15.\n\nState Food Civil Supplies Minister Govind Singh Rajput explained that the delay is due to incomplete wheat harvesting and high moisture content in the wheat arriving at mandis. The high moisture content crop would not meet the fair average quality and fetch comparatively lower prices to the farmers. Farmers have been encouraged to register for wheat procurement at the designated support price centres, with the registration deadline set for March 31. The state government has sent necessary information via SMS to registered farmers.\n\nAdditionally, farmers can register from home through a dedicated web/mobile app or at facility centres in Gram Panchayats, Janpad Panchayats, and Tehsil offices.

For Davidovich Fokina, the victory was also a measure of redemption, having squandered two championship points in Delray Beach earlier this month.\n\nOn the other side of the draw, Tomas Machac booked his place in the final with a hard-fought 6-4, 1-6, 6-4 win over Brandon Nakashima. The Czech rising star, playing in just his second ATP final after Geneva 2024, is on the verge of a career milestone. A title win would not only earn him his first ATP crown but also make him the first Czech player in the ATP Top 50 since Tomas Berdych in 2018.\n\nMachac is the second Czech finalist in Mexican Open history, following Jiri Novak, who won the 1998 title.

Kennedy, Jr. Center for the Reforming Arts, announced today the final spring season, before this example of brutalist Democrat architecture goes under the wrecking ball to make way for the Overreach, a signature development that will rival the Seven Wonders of the World, from the America Canal to Mt. Trumpmore. From the Koru, the tallest sailing yacht in the world, and a token of his rightful esteem from Jeff Bezos, our fearless leader looks across the Gulf of America with pride.\n\n\u201cKicking off the season in the Concert Hall, the Samuel Clemens Prize for American Rumor honors comedian Bill Cosby. Couchman Trump had this to say about the honoree, whose various exploits are legend, \u2018The woke jokers who previously ran this place stripped his manhood from him when they rescinded his previous prize, but I am the resurrection and the way, and I alone can bring him back. He never failed to tickle my funny bone or his own, and I know it will be a night to remember, though apparently many of them weren\u2019t.\u2019 Celebrities honoring the man and the myth include Harvey Weinstein and Anthony Weiner.\n\n\u201cIn the Grand Ole Opera House, our esteemed artistic director had this to say about the premiere of \u2018La Bohe\u0300mian Rhapsody,\u2019 an updated version of Puccini\u2019s classic tale: \u2018I cast the roles of Mimi and Rodolfo \u2014 what kind of name is that, I call him Rudolph, which rhymes with my manservant Musk\u2019s hero Adolf \u2014 with a couple of singers who aren\u2019t losers, Carrie Underwood and Christopher Macchio. They will sock your knocks off, just like they did at my crowning \u2014 I mean inaugural, the second of many, as I like to say.\u2019 Gold Circle tickets will be made available exclusively to kids who download the new Trump Tok app.\n\n\u201cIn the more intimate Eisenhower Theater, soon to be renamed the Lesser Republicans Stage, First Lady Melania Trump will perform a one-woman show taken from her Amazon Prime biopic \u2018I Don\u2019t Care, or a Darn Clever Way to Receive Millions from Bezos and Avoid Conflict-of-Interest.\u2019 The First Lady has been studying with vocal coach Eric Vetro, who had this to say: \u2018Going from preparing Ariana Grande for \u2018Wicked\u2019 to the wicked witch of the Eastern Bloc, I feel that this is a career lowlight on a par with dancing the limbo.\u2019 The First Lady will be marking \u2018X\u2019 on copies of her book in its Franklin Mint Gilded and Scented Edition at the merch table apre\u0300s show. We\u2019ll be taking names at the door.\n\n\u201cOther artists coming this spring, dates to be announced, include New Greenland poet laureate Kanye West, and Kid Rock, reuniting with Pamela Anderson in a night of B-side throwaways and yacht rock sure to spice up your love-life. In the final performance before the Center goes under the ball, an all-star cast of real men pay homage to the spirit of the Village People in \u2018Take Back the YMCA,\u2019 a new musical with lyrics by Donald J. Trump and music by Ted Nugent.

Navigating housing insecurity and mental and physical disabilities, she walked into Witch Slapped looking for comfort.\n\nStore owner Danielle Munn welcomed her in, offering her a place to think and rest and a shoulder to cry on. Before Keir left, Munn let her take a hematite stone, believed to bring positivity and fertility, as a good luck charm.\n\nWith Munn\u2019s support, Keir found the strength to continue her pregnancy and later learned she could deliver safely. Now, her son is 2.\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for this place, he wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d said Keir's partner, Christian Frienden.\n\nFor many in Pittsfield, Witch Slapped is more than a shop. It's a community-supported safe space that offers food, warmth, electricity and something as simple, and yet profound, as the dignity of allowing anyone to use the bathroom. While many nonprofits and the city government provide services to help those struggling with food insecurity or to find housing, gaps in the system remain.\n\nThat's where people like Munn \u2014 as well as the co-op members at nearby Roots & Dreams and Mustard Seeds, and the community organized \"Cooking for Pittsfield\u2019s Hungry on Saturday\" \u2014 have stepped in. \n\nA 'COMMUNITY CENTER'\n\nWitch Slapped, which opened in 2022, is not just a go-to for spiritual products \u2014 items like candles, crystals, incense and wind chimes \u2014 but also a safe community space.\n\nThe sitting room at the store\u2019s entrance at 78 North St. has become a gathering place, of sorts, for North Street residents.\n\nMike Centore, who has been homeless since he was 19, said he comes to Witch Slapped every day for the sense of belonging.\n\n\u201cWhen it's lively around, you'll see a lot of laughing, a lot of conversation, a lot of like, it's really good, you know, it's actually nice,\u201d Centore said.\n\nMunn does not do this work alone. Witch Slapped has an \u201carmy of community members\u201d who support and look out for each other, she said. Besides the actual store, Witch Slapped functions as a community built on mutual aid \u2014 those who can contribute do, and those in need take what they must. While many benefit from Munn\u2019s efforts, everyone plays a role in keeping the space running.\n\n\u201cThe beauty is that we've created a community center so the folks that do utilize us participate,\u201d Munn said. \"There is no asking. Everybody does a little bit of whatever needs to be done.\u201d\n\nBeyond providing a sense of belonging, Witch Slapped helps fill gaps that nonprofits and state services leave behind. Because it operates as a business, the store is not restricted by the same limitations nonprofits face when distributing aid, such as what items they can accept and give out. \n\nSince the city warming shelter doesn\u2019t open until 10 p.m., many people stay at the store to keep warm until it closes \u2014 typically at 8 p.m., except for Wednesdays when it\u2019s open until 10 p.m. and Mondays when it closes at 4 p.m.\n\n\u201cThere is a huge gap in the city for sheltering,\u201d Munn said.\n\nDuring the day, many homeless people seek warmth and shelter at the library and senior center. But on Sundays, when these places are closed, Witch Slapped sees more than 50 visitors. The store also hosts a daily potluck where people can donate and share food. There is also a shelf with nonperishable items for people to take with them.\n\nIn the fall of 2022, Tami Stevens-Goerlach was reading an article in The Berkshire Eagle about the homeless crisis when something caught her eye \u2014 a picture of a longtime friend who was struggling with addiction, and another of a young man whose diapers she had once changed.\n\n\u201cMy husband and I spoke and we said, \u2018Gee, the least we can do is give him a hot meal, right?\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nBut Stevens-Goerlach, who had faced food insecurity and homelessness herself, couldn\u2019t bring food to just one person in need. She decided to offer meals to anyone who was hungry.\n\nThe first week, she prepared about a dozen meals and brought them to local spots like the Mobil station and library, where people had been gathering. However, that still wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nWhile distributing meals, people told Stevens-Goerlach there were no meal sites on Saturdays. She then decided to keep delivering meals every Saturday and shared her plan and a picture of her food on Facebook \u2014 that\u2019s when the community chimed in.\n\n\u201cI got so many phone calls, text messages, people saw me in person, so many Facebook messages, \u2018I\u2019d really love to help you. What can we do to help?\u2019\u201d Stevens-Goerlach said.\n\nFrom there, she created a Facebook group, \"Cooking for Pittsfield\u2019s Hungry on Saturday,\" which now has nearly 300 members.\n\nWith help from the group, Stevens-Goerlach now cooks about 50 hot meals every Saturday and provides bag meals with items like sandwiches, fruit and snacks to ensure those in need have enough food for the entire day.\n\n\u201cI drive down North Street, look at the bus stops, and these people are sitting there, and I'll just pull over and get out and say, \u2018Hey, are you hungry?\u2019\u201d Stevens-Goerlach said, adding that food insecurity affects more people than just the homeless.\n\nStevens-Goerlach\u2019s efforts are centered around treating those she serves with dignity and compassion.\n\n\u201cWe're not here to be judgmental,\u201d she said. \u201cWe're here to accept people for where they're at; just give, and that's it.\"\n\nTAKE WHAT YOU'LL USE\n\nRoots & Dreams and Mustard Seeds, a co-op in Pittsfield that aims to increase working-class ownership and control, also tries to empower those in need.\n\nAt the core of its efforts are cooperative businesses and a free food and clothing market, Mercado de Vida, located at 119 Fenn St. Unlike traditional food pantries, the market allows people to \u201cshop\u201d for the items they need without restrictions.\n\nThe cornerstone of this process is trust.\n\n\u201cWe say, \u2018Well, take what you're going to use. We're going to trust you to just take what you're using,\u2019 and the look on people's faces \u2014 they seem so happy to not be hassled or policed in what they're taking,\u201d said Michael Hitchcock, a director of Roots & Dreams and Mustard Seeds.\n\nThe same applies to the organization\u2019s clothing market in an effort to create a friendly and welcoming environment.\n\n\u201cIf people took five bags of clothes or one item of clothing, we were not bothering them about it,\u201d Hitchcock said. \u201cWe're very happy they found stuff they could use.\u201d\n\nHitchcock and Nicole Fecteau, the group's co-director, view the market as a necessity rather than a solution for poverty in the area.\n\n\u201cWe're trying to build up the groups we work with so that charity would no longer be necessary for any of us,\u201d Hitchcock said.\n\nSusan Pietrowsky, a Witch Slapped regular who is food insecure and lives in poverty, also came to the Fenn Street pantry, eventually volunteering to give back and now works as a part-time employee.\n\n\u201cBut a lot of that was just saying, 'Susan, you're hungry. Show up anyway and hope this becomes income,\u2019\u201d Pietrowsky said. \u201cThey\u2019re a great organization that's doing a lot for the community.\u201d\n\n'NOT ENOUGH HANDS TO HELP'\n\nMunn noted that those struggling in Pittsfield and seeking refuge in her store aren\u2019t just homeless \u2014 many elderly residents in poverty struggle to afford basic necessities, including electricity and heating.\n\n\u201cThey don't have electricity, or they can't afford to pay it,\" Munn said. \"They can't afford to buy more oil. They don't even have the money to charge their phone.\u201d \n\nMany people experiencing hardship are not chronically unhoused, but rather have faced a sudden devastation and are unable to recover due to a lack of resources, Munn said.\n\n\u201cThere are so many more people who are kind and just like us, who literally just hit tragedy, life happened,\u201d Munn said. \u201cAnd once you get down here, once you fall, you can't get back up. There are no resources. There are too many people who are down at this level, and not enough hands to help them up.\u201d\n\nAlthough Munn provides as much as she can, the store runs on community support and receives a wide variety of donations, ranging from clothes to condoms to pet food. There is also a private group of over 2,000 people that Munn can ask for specific donations.\n\n\u201cI have the best people. This store magnetizes the most incredible giving,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's so impressive that even I [am] in shock and awe, and I am proud, and I am feel blessed, and I'm grateful that I'm not alone in this mission.\u201d\n\nBeyond the food, shelter and donations, the store provides something invaluable \u2014 dignity and care.\n\n\u201cWe care, and that makes more difference than the food and the heat and the electricity,\u201d Munn said. \u201cIt's the fact that they are welcomed, they're known by name, they're cared for \u2026 they're part of something there, and they're treated like human beings, and that's more important than anything else.\u201d", "summary": "In Pittsfield, grassroots organizations like Witch Slapped, Roots & Dreams, Mustard Seeds and Cooking for Pittsfield\u2019s Hungry on Saturdays have become vital lifelines for those facing homelessness, hunger and poverty.", "url": "https://www.berkshireeagle.com/news/local/pittsfield-grassroots-organizations-fill-gaps-for-needy/article_e9a40732-f551-11ef-adb8-375e72b7d5e8.html", "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/2b/02b03b02-eefd-11ef-adc0-eb0679730737/67b639c719cbe.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 10:00:00", "author": "Ben Garver \u2014 The Berkshire Eagle,By Maryjane Williams,The Berkshire Eagle", "authors": ["Ben Garver \u2014 The Berkshire Eagle", "By Maryjane Williams", "The Berkshire Eagle"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.123}, {"id": 295590118, "title": "America has a rogue president", "text": "President Trump\u2019s decision to fire senior military leaders without cause is foolish and a disgrace. It politicizes our professional military in a dangerous and debilitating way. What frightens me even more is the removal of three judge advocates general, the most senior uniformed legal authorities in the Defense Department. Their removal is one more element of this administration\u2019s attack on the rule of law, and an especially disturbing part.\n\nLet us start with the senior officers. As secretary of the Air Force in the Biden administration, I worked closely with Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. for two years when he was chief of staff of the Air Force, and for more than a year when he was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In my entire 55 years of working in national security in many capacities, I have never known a steadier, wiser and more professional, patriotic or honorable officer than C.Q. Brown. Gen. James Slife and Adm. Lisa Franchetti are also extremely capable and professional officers whom I know well and deeply admire. They served for decades with honor and distinction over many administrations.\n\nIt pains me to see these fine people being treated so unfairly and, for the first time in my career, to see dedicated, apolitical military professionals being removed without cause. I am worried about political loyalty becoming a criterion to hold high military positions. For now, I have confidence that our professional military has nurtured dozens of highly qualified senior officers capable of holding positions of trust and responsibility, people who can provide leadership at the Pentagon and offer sound military advice to our civilian leaders.\n\nBut that optimism doesn\u2019t extend to the consequences of removing the military\u2019s top judge advocates general, the senior military professionals who interpret and enforce the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the rules that guide troops in the field. They have the independent legal authority to tell any military commander or political appointee that an order from the president or the secretary of defense is unlawful, cannot be given and should not be obeyed.\n\nOf the three JAGs who were dismissed, I know Lt. Gen. Charles Plummer and worked with him for more than three years. His legal advice was always sound, professional and well supported. It is hard to imagine there was any reason to remove him, other than the obvious one of replacing him with someone more loyal to Mr. Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth \u2014 and therefore more willing to interpret the law consistent with their desires.\n\nIf there is one characteristic of this president and this administration, it is the utter lack of respect for legal constraints. Mr. Trump has been clear about his views. Among many examples, he recently wrote, \u201cHe who saves his country does not violate any law.\u201d It is clear from Mr. Hegseth\u2019s confirmation hearing, public appearances, writings and support for convicted war criminals that he also does not believe JAG officers should constrain war fighters \u2014 or presumably the president and secretary of defense.\n\nMr. Trump and Mr. Hegseth will now get to choose the JAG leadership for all three military departments. One has to ask why JAG leadership was singled out for replacement. This is part of a much larger pattern of disrespect, even disdain, for the rule of law. We do not need JAG leaders who fit this pattern.\n\nOne of the most admirable characteristics of the American military is that all serving members are trained to understand that America stands for more than naked self-interest. Above all, it stands up for the Constitution and the rule of law, including the laws of armed conflict and those that restrict the use of the military against American citizens. Undermining those core principles is a disservice to our men and women in uniform and to everything America has stood for throughout my life. We are in danger when the legal constraints on how the president uses the military, including within the United States, are ignored or brushed aside.\n\nMy experiences with our JAG officers have always been positive. One stands out in particular. Years ago, I was an observer for the nonprofit organization Human Rights First at a legal proceeding for a detainee held at the military facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. In a briefing to observers and the media, the lead JAG defense attorney made a statement to the following effect: Whoever set up this prosecution system assumed that there would be quick trials with no meaningful defense by the assigned JAG officers. Those people did not understand JAG lawyers. We will support the rule of law and defend our clients, whomever they are.\n\nI have never been prouder to be an American than I was in that moment. We will see if the new JAG leadership lives up to this standard.\n\nOur country is in uncharted territory. We have an administration that is waging war against the rule of law. The evidence is everywhere. We don\u2019t yet know how far it will go as it seeks to control, reinterpret, rewrite, ignore or defy legal constraints, including the Constitution itself. The replacement of the military JAG leadership is one skirmish in that war, but it\u2019s time for the American people, across the political spectrum, to recognize what is happening. America has a rogue president and a rogue administration, and we need to acknowledge that and respond.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.", "summary": "Our country is in uncharted territory.

This change in protocol would break precedent set by Mayor Macksey throughout her administration, though the city\u2019s charter does grant the mayor the authority to appoint commission members without the council\u2019s OK, according to the city\u2019s solicitor. While the letter of the charter says Mayor Macksey does not need councilors\u2019 consent on appointments, the spirit of good governance suggests she should still avail herself of their advice.\n\nThis is not just a theoretical argument in favor of the separation of powers between the city\u2019s executive and legislative officers, though our tumultuous national political climate underscores the importance of preserving such checks and balances. There are very practical reasons why the mayor should welcome additional perspectives from city leaders outside her office if she wants to make the best appointments on behalf of the city.\n\nIn fact, a perfect example lies in the appointment that prompted this change. When Mayor Macksey moved to appoint Doug Herrick to the city\u2019s embattled Airport Commission, some councilors raised concerns that Mr. Herrick\u2019s connections to Harriman-and-West Airport via the Mohawk Soaring Club might present a conflict of interest. The context of Mr. Herrick\u2019s potential conflict might not have been raised as prominently in this case if the City Council did not weigh in. We don\u2019t have to weigh in on whether Mr. Herrick is the best person for the job to simply note it\u2019s a good thing if relevant facts about commission appointees are brought publicly to citizens by the representatives they elected.\n\nWe understand the pressure and frustration facing the mayor as she seeks to fill vacancies on the Airport Commission, whose mission and public perception have been hamstrung by recent controversy. Yet such controversy only further underscores why more oversight, not less, is what\u2019s best for appointments to city commissions and boards.\n\nWe aren\u2019t questioning the city solicitor\u2019s interpretation of the charter, and we aren\u2019t suggesting it be amended. We are simply saying there is a wiser middle ground the mayor can tread between seeking City Council approval of commission nominees and noting appointments to the council for public acknowledgement only. Bringing mayoral appointment decisions to the council for recommendation, if not approval, seems prudent. This would essentially continue the precedent the Macksey administration had already established over the years she\u2019s been in office up until the recent spat over Airport Commission appointments.\n\nIn accordance with the city charter, such a recommendation wouldn\u2019t be binding, and the mayor could proceed with an appointment regardless of the council\u2019s input.\n\nStill, why not allow the City Council to make a reasonable recommendation? More information and oversight is always better. Councilors might know something about an appointee that could better inform the mayor\u2019s decision before she finalizes it, which she should welcome.\n\nMeanwhile, the process would better inform the people of North Adams on who is being tapped to lead their city\u2019s boards and commissions. Else, those voters could be forgiven for asking why the mayor would deny a public vetting of her appointments and the disinfecting sunlight that comes with that process.

In 1938, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain proclaimed that he had secured \u201cpeace in our time\u201d by handing over the Sudetenland (in Czechoslovakia) to Adolf Hitler\u2019s Germany in exchange for a promise to seek no more additional territory in Europe. Hitler\u2019s promise was of course worthless, and Chamberlain\u2019s foolish claim to have secured a lasting peace has been mocked ever since.\n\nThe simple truth is that you cannot create peace by ceding territory to an expansionist dictator who is aggressively building his war machine. For 75 years \u2014 until recently \u2014 the Republican Party led our country in supporting NATO and taking a hard line against Russian expansionism. There are still dozens of Republicans in Congress who know that Trump\u2019s Ukraine surrender initiative is a tragic error, but so far they are unwilling to criticize Trump publicly. They need to speak up, as we all do.\n\nPutin has made his intentions clear. He wants to build a new Russian empire. He has been trying to control Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine for two decades, and the Baltic states and Poland are surely in his sights after that.\n\nBecause he is an authoritarian leader surrounded by yes-men who are afraid to tell him the truth, he miscalculated when he rolled tanks into Ukraine, He thought he would take control of the country in a week. But three years later, he has only taken 20 percent of Ukraine, and he has sustained huge losses to his army and his weaponry. Interest rates in Russia are 21 percent, and inflation is about 10 percent. Recent territorial gains are small, and casualties incurred in those battles are high. Putin badly needs a break so he can rebuild his economy and his military. If Trump were a tough negotiator, he could extract significant territorial concessions by threatening to redouble sanctions on Russia and military aid to Ukraine.\n\nBut above all else, what a tough negotiator would bring home from peace talks in Ukraine is security guarantees ensuring that Russia doesn't use this ceasefire as an opportunity to rebuild its war machine and attack Ukraine again later with overwhelming force. I fear that Trump is not focused on that and just wants to end the war so Russia can sell oil again without restriction, and Trump can take credit for low oil prices.\n\nAlex Brooks, Williamstown", "summary": "To the editor: President Donald Trump boasts he will \u201cmake a deal\u201d that will bring peace to Europe.", "url": "https://www.berkshireeagle.com/opinion/letters_to_editor/letter-on-ukraine-trump-takes-after-neville-chamberlain/article_591bad9a-f462-11ef-9178-e799605dd38b.html", "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 10:00:00", "author": "Blox Content Management", "authors": ["Blox Content Management"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.111}, {"id": 295590114, "title": "Letter: In the court of King Donald", "text": "To the editor: Like most people these days, I feel swamped by the news and unable to turn away from the disaster I see unfolding before me.\n\nDonald Trump clearly intends to become a dictator \u2014 he already calls himself \"king.\" The government is being dismantled before our eyes as Elon Musk indiscriminately cuts employees at various agencies and intimidates the rest. Republicans in Congress are already intimidated, and only a few Democratic leaders seem to have found their voices. Trump has taken over the real power centers, including the DOJ, FBI and Department of Defense by inserting his stooges at the tops of those agencies.\n\nMeanwhile, our would-be dictator has made no bones about his affinity for other dictators. His bestie is Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, with whom he has had a long if mostly covert relationship. Now Trump is throwing Ukraine overboard and with it Europe as if these countries had no relationship to American security. Maybe he and Vlad have agreed to divide up the world, with Putin getting Europe and Trump getting the Americas, Greenland and the Middle East. That would leave Asia and Africa to China\u2019s Xi Jinping, who is already pursuing his ambition to dominate those parts of the world.\n\nNowhere in this world-dominating, antidemocratic strategy is there any thought about how to improve the lot of Americans, who will become less safe and less free. Yes, the administration will deport many undocumented immigrants, which will undoubtedly please the millions of MAGA backers who voted for Trump. But the resultant labor shortages, coupled with higher prices brought on by Trump\u2019s tariffs, will feed inflation and probably bring on a deep recession. Not to worry, however. The billionaire class will get their tax cuts, paid for largely by the tax increase of $2,600 a year that the average American family will pay in higher prices for imports.\n\nThe human toll of the suffering inflicted on federal workers and everyone who receives federal services is being totally ignored. Maybe one of these days, the working-class folks who voted for Trump to bring down prices will wake up and realize that the opposite is happening.

Meanwhile, prosecutors hide behind these laws, failing to address the critical issue of consent itself.\n\nRape is often framed in simplistic terms: the violent stranger in an alley, a victim fighting to escape. But as countless survivors know, it doesn\u2019t always look like that. Massachusetts law recognizes this reality.\n\nUnder Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 265, Section 22, prosecutors don\u2019t need to prove physical force to establish rape. They can instead rely on implied force, demonstrating that the victim submitted out of fear, intimidation or coercion.\n\nThe law allows prosecutors to consider the victim\u2019s age, size and relationship to the perpetrator \u2014 especially when the perpetrator is an authority figure. In other words, Massachusetts law already provides a path to hold predators in schools and youth organizations accountable. The question is whether DAs will use it.\n\nProsecutors must stop taking the easy way out. Just because a student is 16 does not mean they consented to sex with their teacher. The law does not require blind acceptance of this dangerous assumption.\n\nAt the same time, we remain committed to changing Massachusetts\u2019 consent law once and for all.

The already tense meeting escalated when Vance emphasised the importance of diplomacy in resolving Europe's largest conflict since World War II. With his arms crossed, Zelenskiy pushed back, arguing that Putin could not be trusted and pointing out that Vance had never visited Ukraine.\nHere are some of the highlights from the exchange between the three leaders:\nVance: \u201cFor four years, the United States of America, we had a president who stood up at press conferences and talked tough about Vladimir Putin, and then Putin invaded Ukraine and destroyed a significant chunk of the country. The path to peace and the path to prosperity is, maybe, engaging in diplomacy. We tried the pathway of Joe Biden, of thumping our chest and pretending that the president of the United States\u2019 words mattered more than the president of the United States\u2019 actions. What makes America a good country is America engaging in diplomacy. That\u2019s what President Trump is doing.\u201d\nZelenskyy: \u201cCan I ask you?\u201d\nVance: \u201cSure. Yeah.\u201d\nZelenskyy: \u201cOK. So he (Putin) occupied it, our parts, big parts of Ukraine, parts of east and Crimea. So he occupied it in 2014. So during a lot of years \u2014 I\u2019m not speaking about just Biden, but those times was (Barack) Obama, then President Obama, then President Trump, then President Biden, now President Trump. And God bless, now, President Trump will stop him. But during 2014, nobody stopped him. He just occupied and took. He killed people. You know what the --\"\nTrump: \u201c2015?\u201d\nZelenskyy: \u201c2014.\u201d\nTrump: \u201cOh, 2014?

Nobody stopped him. You know that we had conversations with him, a lot of conversations, my bilateral conversation. And we signed with him, me, like, you, president, in 2019, I signed with him the deal. I signed with him, (French President Emmanuel) Macron and (former German Chancellor Angela) Merkel. We signed ceasefire. Ceasefire. All of them told me that he will never go \u2026 But after that, he broke the ceasefire, he killed our people, and he didn\u2019t exchange prisoners.

She had a beautiful smile.\n\n\"There was this enthusiasm and energy to her, and I loved her eyes \u2013 they were shining. There was lots of life in there. So we started to talk, it was very quick; I can\u2019t even remember what I said, but we had a date the very same night in Peckham [south-east London].\u201d\n\n\u2018Fruitcake\u2019 is Fred\u2019s nickname for his other half, and when TV Mag asks why he calls her that, he simply says: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you because it\u2019s only between her and me. It\u2019s nice to have something private.\u201d\n\nFred\u2019s a traditionally private man, but has found his profile ever-growing since he made his TV debut as the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 in the First Dates restaurant back in 2013. He\u2019s been playing matchmaker for 23 series now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to diss Love Island or anything like that, but people don\u2019t come on First Dates because they want to make money or be famous, they come to find love, and that is pure; you don\u2019t have to \u2018couple up\u2019 to win the prize,\u201d he smiles.\n\n\u201cThere is no prize, no money and no glory besides finding love. They have five minutes on television and can hopefully come back home with a person that they want to be with for the rest of their lives. It\u2019s beautiful. I\u2019m a romantic at heart.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s such a simple premise \u2013 viewers watch strangers having a conversation over dinner \u2013 but Fred knows exactly why First Dates continues to be so captivating.\n\n\u201cWe all have baggage, we\u2019ve all had relationships, and there\u2019s a lot of pain that comes with love, so people come and sometimes their stories will be shocking to us, or they\u2019ll be inspiring, exciting, or sometimes scary,\u201d explains Fred, who was general manager for restaurant Galvin at Windows in London\u2019s Park Lane Hilton when he signed up for First Dates.\n\n\u201cSome people have known incredible hardship \u2013 you know, their partner or children could die on them, they could come from war zones. I had a very happy childhood, and I think I\u2019ve been quite shielded from a lot of the pain some people have, but suddenly you are there and you realise what people are going through.\n\n\u201cThis is why I think people like First Dates so much. We can relate to these people, even though maybe their story is something that is beyond our imagination, because we can\u2019t imagine how they went through this and still find that desire to find love again, to be vulnerable again, when they have been hurt, betrayed or worse. This is a real show, real people, and we move heaven and earth to find them a match.\u201d\n\nAnd father-of-two Fred is always willing to share his own experiences of romance to dish out advice to the singletons.\n\n\u201cRelationships are never, ever done,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to work at them. Fruitcake and I have date nights. We try to go out once a week, to do something special. This is the day we reserve just for us.\u201d\n\nAnd how about his relationship with former co-star Gino D\u2019Acampo? While Fred was speaking to us before the scandal broke about Gino\u2019s alleged behaviour, when TV Mag asked if he\u2019d be doing any more shows with either or both of Gino and Gordon Ramsay (inset above), he replied: \u201cWe might, we\u2019ll see \u2013 it depends on time. They are both very busy. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nRight now, of course, any such reunion on telly seems unlikely, but it sounds like Fred will have plenty of projects to keep him busy, and he admits that his passion for fine dining could develop into something more substantial \u2013 namely his own restaurant.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been looking at things, to be honest with you,\u201d he confesses.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be sure of the location, because at the moment, the climate is very difficult. Prices have gone up. It\u2019s really tough and you cannot just rely on your name. It\u2019s a cutthroat business.\u201d\n\nAnd given his love of fine wine, could we see him follow in the likes of Gary Barlow, Graham Norton and his pal Gordon\u2019s footsteps and release his own brand?\n\n\u201cYeah, of course,\u201d he enthuses. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to make sure of the quality to maintain your reputation. Fruitcake, who\u2019s never studied wine, has an incredible palate. And my son [Lucien], who\u2019s 15, is the same. He can\u2019t drink, really, but whenever I get a nice bottle of wine, I wet his lips a little bit. My daughter [Team GB champion diver Andrea, 20] doesn\u2019t drink alcohol, but I\u2019m really sold on wine. It\u2019s one of my passions.\u201d\n\nEven with his love of food and drink, Fred has managed to stay in incredible shape (below), as we\u2019ve often seen when he\u2019s stripped off on his road trips.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got a choice,\u201d Fred says. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved being active, so if I don\u2019t do it, I wouldn\u2019t feel good. I\u2019m 53, I\u2019ve got to be able to be as strong and flexible for as long as I can.

OR OFF\n\nIfab will meet in Belfast on Saturday for their annual general meeting - with video support systems and updates to the offside rule also on the agenda.\n\nVideo support enables coaches to challenge referee decisions - similar to tennis or cricket - and the referee can then watch the video back of their decision and uphold the original or overrule their call. \n\nThe format, designed for competitions that do not have the capabilities for VAR, has been tested in Fifa's Women's Under-17 and Under-20 World Cups.\n\nThe offside rule update could give greater advantage to attacking players.\n\nAn attacker would be onside if at least some part of their body is level with the second-last defender - known as the 'daylight' rule - even if the rest of their body is ahead. \n\nArsene Wenger - Fifa's chief of global football development - has advocated the 'daylight' rule, which has been trialled in U18s football in Italy.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/14416995/football-laws-rule-change-goalkeepers/", "image": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/crop-33627441.jpg?1740821815&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 09:36:31", "author": "Joshua Jones", "authors": ["Joshua Jones"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.022}, {"id": 295590078, "title": "Six household dupes including mattresses, washing powder and vacs just as good as expensive rivals but HALF the price", "text": "Shoppers could save HUNDREDS of pounds buying cheaper dupes for more expensive products that cost around double the price or more.\n\nThe Sun has trawled through review sites and thousands of customer reviews to uncover the best value home and tech products.\n\nWe checked reviews from experts and customers and compared core features for the dupe and its expensive rival. \n\nWe picked items that either the experts highlighted for their value for money, or that scored at least 4 out of 5 from a solid number of customer reviews (more than 30) or both.\n\nOf course, this is just a snapshot look at products and as always you should do your own research before purchasing.\n\nPrices were correct at the time of publication but as they change regularly you will need to compare before you buy.\n\nWhen you compare prices, use the full model number of the product you want to buy to ensure you\u2019re getting prices for the same model from different sites. \n\nSome models have a different price in a different colour, for example.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget to check what manufacturer\u2019s warranty comes with it - especially for a big ticket item like an oven.We picked six products below: \n\nIkea Vestmarka firm mattress\n\n\u00a3139 from IkeaSaving: \u00a3230.75\n\nConsumer group Which? recently revealed that the Ikea Vestmarka mattress is very popular among its members. \n\nAt \u00a3139 for a double, this firm, open-coil sprung mattress is a fraction of the price of many rivals. \n\nBut it can hold its own against competitors like the pocket-sprung Silentnight Studio Eco mattress, which is currently \u00a3369.75 at Mattressman. \n\nYou\u2019ll typically pay over \u00a3300 for a great double mattress, but the Vestmarka is less than half that, for a great night\u2019s sleep.\n\nXiaomi Mi Smart Band 9 fitness tracker\n\n\u00a334, AmazonSaving \u00a350\n\nThe Xiaomi Mi Smart Band 9 fitness tracker is a recent model from a brand that offers cheap alternatives to high-end names, but gets high praise from the experts. \n\nAfter the Smart Band 9 launched last summer, tech review site TechRadar hailed it \u201ca hit\u201d, giving it 4 out of 5 stars and saying it \u201cdramatically undercuts some big-name rivals such as Fitbit\u201d.\n\nAnother expert review awarded it 90% and called it \u201cunbeatable value\u201d.While the Smart Band 9 is fairly basic, it covers the main functions - built-in heart rate monitor, sleep tracking, step counting, and calorie counting. You can take it for a swim, and there\u2019s a touchscreen and removable strap. The tracker can connect to iOS (Apple) and Android phones.This is pretty similar to the Fitbit Inspire 3, which, like the Smart Band 9, doesn\u2019t have a built-in GPS. But the Fitbit Inspire 3 will set you back \u00a384 at Amazon, Argos or Currys - more than double the cost of its rival. \n\nVax Gator Cordless Handheld vac\n\n\u00a340, ArgosSaving: \u00a388\n\nSome handheld vacs conk out after a few minutes when the battery needs another charge. \n\nBut this one gives you 15 minutes of run time, and comes with a special crevice tool to reach into corners and suck up the crumbs down the back of the sofa. \n\nThe downside is it takes 12 hours to recharge for the next round.The Gator has 1,500+ reviews on Argos, where customers gave it 4.3 out of 5 and 87% recommend it. One recent reviewer called it a \u201clittle gem\u201d.So the battle is on - Gator vs Shark. The Shark WandVac WV270 UK cordless handheld is a bestseller on the John Lewis website where it costs \u00a3128 and gets 4.4 out of 5 from customer reviews. \n\nIt comes with a handy charging dock, which the Gator doesn\u2019t have.The Shark\u2019s reviews on Argos are pretty similar to the Gator\u2019s, with customers giving it 4.4 out of 5, and 87% recommending it. And it has the same running time of 15 minutes but recharges faster than the Gator - in just 3.5 hours.So if you don\u2019t mind a longer recharge time and the lack of a charging dock, this Gator will give the Shark a run for your money.\n\nAldi Almat Biological Washing Powder 2kg/40 Washes \n\n\u00a33.85, Aldi, (\u00a31.93/kg, 10p per wash)Saving: 11p per wash vs Ariel\n\nThe box of this Aldi powder proudly displays an endorsement from the Good Housekeeping Institute, so it\u2019s stood up to some tough testing.Almat bio is competing with bio powders from the likes of Ariel and Persil. \n\nAt Tesco, a 2.1kg box of Persil Biological Laundry Washing Powder gives you 42 washes for \u00a37, so around 17p per wash. \n\nAnd if you splashed out on a mega pack 3kg/50 washes box of Ariel, it would cost you \u00a310.50 at Tesco. That\u2019s 21p a wash, so more than double Almat, per wash.\n\nGino D\u2019Acampo Fast Boil Kettle \n\n\u00a316.94, AsdaSaving: \u00a316.06\n\nThis kettle is normally \u00a327 but even at that price, it\u2019s good value for money. At \u00a310 less, it\u2019s a steal.With its sleek looks, fast boiling time and soft-touch finish, this kettle will add style to your countertop and comes in black, green, grey and glass.On the Asda site, customers give this model the thumbs-up. There are different reviews for the different colour versions, ranging from 4 to 4.6 out of 5. \n\nThe product measures up well to the Breville High Gloss Kettle, which comes in grey and cream - reviewers on the Breville site give it 4.7 out of 5. We found it for \u00a333 on Amazon and \u00a339.98 at B&Q.Asda\u2019s kettle and this Breville both offer 3kW of power, and on both, the water gauge is under the handle, so a little awkward to see, but that\u2019s the price of having a minimalist look.\n\nThey both boil fast and hold 1.7 litres. But only one of them is currently less than \u00a320.\n\nBeko AeroPerfect single oven \n\n\u00a3179 at CurrysSaving: \u00a3190\n\nLast year, Beko scooped the Which? Best Value Appliance Brand of the Year award after a range of its models did well in Which? tests. \n\nOver on the Beko site, it proudly displays that at least one AeroPerfect oven was awarded Best Buy status in built-in oven tests in 2023. \n\nThe cheapest we could find in that range is the AeroPerfect RecycledNet BBXIF22100S which is available at Currys.Hundreds of reviewers on currys.co.uk gave it a score, totalling 4.5 out of 5, with one recent reviewer calling it \u201camazing value for money\u201d. \n\nThis 60cm built-in single fan oven\u2019s AeroPerfect technology ensures a consistent air flow, meaning you get evenly baked cakes and pastry.\n\nIt can grill, roast and bake and Beko offers a 10-year parts guarantee. This oven can\u2019t clean itself, though, which some ovens can.\n\nIf you don\u2019t mind doing without a programmable touch display, this Beko oven will hold its own against the Zanussi FanCook ZOHCX3X2 electric oven, which is \u00a3369 at Currys. \n\nJust over 200 reviewers gave their verdict on this model on the Currys site, totalling 4.4 out of 5 -

however this was capped below inflation.\n\nHowever, this year's price rises will heap more misery on commuters who cannot drive or walk to work.\n\nThe hike applies to fares regulated by the Government, such as season tickets on most commuter journeys and some off-peak return tickets on long-distance routes.\n\nTrain companies can set their own ticket prices on unregulated fares.\n\nThe current cost of a weekly commute from Oxford to London is \u00a36,396, which will rise to \u00a36,692 from March 2 -

sixteen years after their last performance.\n\nTaking to Reddit, one music fan wrote: \"They have a concert in the Netherlands on June 27, but the rest of Glasto's days are off.\"\n\n\"They returned to concerts a few years ago, but this year they are coming back to really big festivals, e.g. Coachella, I think they would be perfect for Glastonbury.\"\n\nAnother added: \"They are way overdue another appearance and honestly they could easily headline a stage.\"\n\nA third penned: \"I really hope so. They were supposed to play in 2019.\"\n\nA fourth chimed in: \"Would love this. They're heavily rumoured to be playing.\"\n\nKeith Flint, 49, was found dead at his Essex home in March 2019.\n\nA coroner's inquest later ruled that there was insufficient evidence to determine whether his death was a suicide or an accident.\n\nFollowing his passing, The Prodigy canceled all upcoming shows.\n\nAt Glastonbury 2019, The Chemical Brothers paid tribute to Keith, dedicating their set to him. \n\nMeanwhile, Gizz Butt, a former bandmate of Keith\u2019s, was set to perform a DJ set at the festival but withdrew, fearing it would be seen as self-promotion. \n\nThis year, The Prodigy will be performing at Coachella after the line-up was unveiled. \n\nThey will be joining other music groups Kraftwerk and Above & Beyond, as they make their triumphant returns to the electronic music scene. \n\nLady Gaga, Green Day, Post Malone and Travis Scott will headline the event. \n\nOther artists on the bill include Charli XCX, FKA twigs Missy Elliott, Megan Thee Stallion, Mustard, Tyla, Japanese Breakfast, Arca, Gel and many more.\n\nThe Prodigy have had seven UK No\u200a1 albums and two No\u200a1 singles.\n\nThey took a four-year break but returned with a hit European tour.\n\nMaxim said: \u201cYou can\u2019t replace Keith.

It's about domestic violence and it's about sexuality. There's so many different aspects and groups of people that this movie can affectChristy Martin\n\nA movie, directed by acclaimed Aussie filmmaker David Michod and starring actress of the moment Sydney Sweeney as Christy, wrapped in late 2024.\n\nNetflix also chronicled the tale with a powerful documentary called Untold: Deal with the Devil released in 2021.\n\nSpeaking to SunSport, Christy, 56, told us: \"To me, it's the underdog story.\n\n\"It's not a boxing movie. It's about domestic violence and it's about sexuality. There's so many different aspects and groups of people that this movie can affect.\n\n\"The meaning behind the movie, for me, is don't hide who you are - whatever it be, whatever makes you different. Be true to you.\"\n\nChristy admitted she was surprised, at first, by the casting of Hollywood superstar Sweeney.\n\n\"My first reaction was, 'Wow, it kind of doesn't fit,'\" she said.\n\n\"But when I spoke with Sydney, I learned she actually has an MMA background. We had some great conversations.\n\n\"She is very much a competitor, like I was. I think this role will show people a whole other side to her they are not used to seeing.\n\n\"She's very real and a completely normal person, not like some Hollywood people I have met in my life and throughout my boxing career.\"\n\nChristy met future hubby Jim when she was 22 and he was 47. She was an up and coming boxer, and he promised her the world by claiming he had contacts that could get her to the top of the tree.\n\nThey married in 1991, although it was a marriage of convenience. Before Jim, Christy was in relationships with women.\n\n\"I got involved with Jim by accident,\" she said.\n\n\"It was one of those things, I was impressionable and young and he claimed he knew everyone in the boxing business.\"\n\nBy the mid 1990s, Christy became a showbiz name in her own right.\n\nShe featured on the undercard for Mike Tyson's pay-per-view fight against Frank Bruno, and appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated.\n\nThere was even an appearance on classic US TV sitcom Roseanne.\n\nBut away from the public eye, she was under duress from Jim who controlled her every move.\n\nThat included trash-talking gay fighters, even though she was hiding her own past and sexuality.\n\nChristy revealed: \"Jim would encourage me to trash talk fighters who were gay.\n\n\"I would tell him, 'You're treading on thin ice because if I say something, then someone from my past might hear it and come out of the woodwork'.\n\n\"I would always tell him he was pushing me to walk a dangerous line.\n\n\"It could have come out at any point, at any time, and something could have exposed me. How would I have looked then?\n\n\"I was living two lives with what was going on in front of the camera and what was happening behind closed doors.\n\n\"We would argue about everything, at press conferences, at home. I got to the point where I would pick and choose my battles.\"\n\nTheir blistering rows would often erupt into violence. \n\n\"Once he knocked my tooth through my lip when I tried to leave him,\" Christy confessed.\n\n\"I had put a contract together to go our separate ways. I just wanted to live my life and go in a different direction. But I was his personal ATM. Without me what was he going to do?\"\n\nAs their relationship further deteriorated, Christy began to get hooked on cocaine, which she used to ease her pain.\n\nAs he was beating my head into the dresser, I thought, 'You know motherf***er, you are not going to kill me. Not today.'Christy Martin\n\nOn November 23, 2010 it all came to a head. After spending a few days with her friend, Sherry Lusk, Christy returned to their Florida home to find an agitated Martin.\n\nShe recalled: \"I had a headache, so I went to lay down in the bedroom. The entire time I'm laying down, I could hear Jim sharpening a knife.\n\n\"Then I overheard him talking on the phone, calling people up and telling them I left him for a woman.\n\n\"I got up and I was getting ready to go for a run. I put one shoe on and then he came into the bedroom.\n\n\"He said, 'I have something to show you.' I thought he had a boxing contract, but instead he had a knife and a gun.\n\n\"He started to stab me and cut me up and we got into a fight. In my mind, I was ready to die. \n\n\"But, as he was beating my head into the dresser, I thought, 'You know motherf***er, you are not going to kill me. Not today.'\n\n\"It was like a switch just flipped and I wanted to live. When he cut me, he cut his own hand. And so he stopped beating me and went to clean up his own hand.\n\n\"I started to walk out the room. He came back in and picked up the gun. I said to him, 'You don't have the balls to shoot me.'\n\n\"But he did. He shot me and I remember I just prayed to God and asked for a way to get out.\"\n\nChristy was stabbed four times in the chest, her left lung was punctured, her left leg was sliced to the bone, and a bullet was lodged three inches from her heart.\n\nCallous Martin left his wife for dead on the bedroom floor and went to have a shower.\n\n\"I heard the shower water turn on and that was God telling me it's time, Christy, now's the time. So I tried to get up, but blood was coming out of all these holes,\" she said.\n\nMiraculously, she managed to make it out of their condo, before flagging down a stranger who rushed her to a nearby hospital.\n\nShe survived her ordeal, as she believes, by the grace of God.\n\nIn the emergency room, as she recovered from her wounds, she was also able to kick her drug habit to the kerb.\n\n\"I had always been that athlete that said no to drugs,\" she said.\n\n\"In college, you smoke weed in high school and college and stuff - but I said I was never going to get addicted.\n\n\"But cocaine became my drug of choice, and it was because I was so miserable with Jim. I was trying to find a happy place.\n\nI had always been that athlete that said no to drugsChristy\n\n\"Cocaine was putting me in that happy place, even though it was really killing me and putting me in a worse place. It was an escape every day for around three years.\n\n\"I quit because I wasn't miserable anymore. I was free of Jim. I didn't need that drug anymore.\"\n\nChristy is thankful to be alive to tell her story, which she hopes will help women who have been in similar situations to her.\n\n\"I made a deal with God in the hospital,\" she told us.\n\n\"You know, you let me live through this and I promise you I'm going to help. I'm going to help at least one person every day so they don't suffer what I went through.\n\n\"That's why I keep talking about domestic violence because I gotta keep up my end of the bargain.\"", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/14417068/christy-martin-sydney-sweeney-biopic-husband-kill/", "image": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/crop-33301265.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 09:47:57", "author": "Jon Boon", "authors": ["Jon Boon"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.057}, {"id": 295590060, "title": "Ultra-rare Land Rover Defender inspired by James Bond film with a supercharged V8 engine hits market for 5-figure sum", "text": "AN ULTRA-rare Land Rover Defender inspired by a James Bond film with a supercharged V8 engine has hit the market for a five-figure sum.\n\nThe Defender 90, which has been billed as \"rare opportunity to own a piece of royal history\", dates from 2010.\n\nIt was supplied new to the Royal Garage at Highgrove House that year - to be used exclusively by King Charles and Camilla, the then Prince and Duchess of Cornwall.\n\nAnd now, royal fans could be able to pick it up for the reasonable sum of \u00a350,000.\n\nImages reveal the royal car finished in Keswick Green with a Charcoal Grey interior with only minimal wear, on the driver's seat.\n\nIt also features heated seats and front and rear screens, which are rare for a Defender.\n\nThe motor, which featured in the 2021 release No Time to Die, was specifically designed for Charles and Camilla by JLR Special Vehicles.\n\nPlus, the original confirmation letter, addressed to Tim Williams, Head Chauffeur to HRH The Prince of Wales and TRH The Duchess of Cornwall, is retained in the vehicle's history file.\n\nThe car and letter have recently formed part of a dedicated Royal Collection, cared for by its current owner.\n\nThe listing by Iconic Auctioneers reads: \"Accompanied by original paperwork, the vehicle includes a Land Rover Motoring Users Guide, Land Rover Assistance Membership Card, and a Certificate of Motor Insurance from the period.\n\n\"The original service book shows its first service was completed by M.J.

I live here, but I wouldn\u2019t spend my time socialising here. \n\n\u201cI work in Bishopbriggs and go out in Glasgow. The shopping centre is a concrete monstrosity, the high street is dead.

That\u2019s more of a nationwide issue.\u201d\n\nBut added: \u201cThe rest of Cumbernauld is a s*****e. I can\u2019t wait to get out of it. \n\n\u201cIt comes as no surprise to me that it\u2019s one of the worst places to live in the country. It\u2019s depressing living here. It\u2019s so grey.

I do spend a lot of time here, but there\u2019s nothing to do. It looks like an abandoned mess. It\u2019s mince. The college is quite good, but apart from that, it\u2019s dire.\u201d\n\nAmong the biggest complaints among locals is the lack of infrastructure. The study by the Sunday Times showed it ranked 32 out of 32 for listed buildings. \n\nNHS targets and satisfaction with GPs isn\u2019t much better - sitting at 30 and 31 respectively.\n\n'It's a ghost town'\n\nJane Peden, a 64-year-old retired carer told the Scottish Sun: \u201cAirdrie is a ghost town. It\u2019s a disgrace. \n\n\u201cThere are far too many nail salons and vape shops taking over the high street. \n\n\u201cWhen I was younger, it used to be bustling. It\u2019s sad to see it going so downhill.\u201d\n\nMum-of-one Sarah Simpson, 56, added: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here. There are more junkies and jakies than anything else. It\u2019s a riot, and it\u2019s unsafe. \n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t enough houses for anyone. Private lets are a fortune. \n\n\"The GPs are laughable. The waiting times are beyond a joke. There\u2019s nothing for the kids to do either. And there are virtually no jobs going. You need to travel out of here to find anything half decent.\u201d\n\nRetired plasterer Alex Campbell, 69, said: \u201cEvery day you\u2019re down here, you see homeless people on the streets. It\u2019s quite embarrassing, a sad sight. Poverty is rife. \n\n\u201cSince Covid, the town centre has seen a real downfall. It\u2019s all just charity shops nowadays. It\u2019s murder trying to get an appointment with a GP as well. The facilities are really lacking for folk.\u201d\n\nAnd new dad Kieran Gilluley, 23, said: \u201cIt\u2019s depressing here. I\u2019ve lived here all my life. It\u2019s full of junkies and a********s. \n\n\"With the GPs, you could be dying and still wouldn\u2019t get seen to. I had a collapsed lung not long ago, and the hospital sent me away. They told me I was fine.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time North Lanarkshire has been in the spotlight for the wrong reasons. \n\nIn 2023, the local authority was described as the most \u201cbroken\u201d area in the country by the New Britain Project - looking at the performance of services like NHS, education and policing.\n\n'Community spirit is maintained'\n\nWidow Ann Hulme, 72, said that despite the difficulties, the community spirit has maintained throughout and it \u201ckeeps you going\u201d. \n\nShe said: \u201cI love Coatbridge. I was born and bred here, but there aren\u2019t half the facilities there used to be. \n\n\u201cThe community centres and libraries are still here, but there isn\u2019t much else for people to do. But I think the sense of community has sustained over the years. \n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s very friendly, and that keeps you going.\u201d\n\nBut taxi driver Gerry Summers, 64, added: \u201cThere\u2019s a distinct lack of infrastructure here. Coatbridge is certainly not what it was. It\u2019s lost its character. \n\n\u201cThe government and council have just let it get so run down. There are cuts left, right and centre, and they\u2019re forever promising to regenerate this place, but it\u2019s never come to fruition. \"\n\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s shocking. The buildings are falling apart. I sit in this taxi rank, and most of our customers are coming from Asda and other big brand businesses. There\u2019s no circular economy. The money being spent here just goes into the pockets of the bigwigs.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile retired welder Charlie Harrison, 79, said: \u201cI stay in Airdrie, but I come to Coatbridge to go to the shops. It\u2019s only a fraction better. These places have just deteriorated over time. The shops are derelict. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing for the youngsters, and that\u2019s why there\u2019s so much carry-on on the streets. Everywhere\u2019s smashed up.

months.\n\nHouseholds with outdated Radio Teleswitch Service (RTS) meters must upgrade to a smart meter in the next six months, EDF has warned.\n\nElectricity meters that rely on the RTS will stop working after June 30, 2025.\n\nHundreds of thousands of customers on Economy 7 and other multi-rate energy tariffs use these electricity meters.\n\nThey work by charging customers cheaper rates depending on the time of day.\n\nThe devices rely on the RTS, which broadcasts a signal alongside the long-wave channel for BBC Radio 4.\n\nThe signal is picked up by the meter and used to switch electricity rates at different points in the day.\n\nSome RTS electricity meters can also automatically turn heating and hot water systems on and off during certain hours.\n\nBut when the RTS signal is switched off for good these meters will no longer function as intended.\n\nThis means that from June these meters could be stuck on peak-time electricity rates depending on when the RTS signal shuts off.\n\nThis could result in huge bill hikes for households affected by the switch-off.\n\nSome heating systems are also controlled by RTS.\n\nWhen the signal is switched off it could mean that they are stuck on or off permanently.\n\nMore than 60,000 EDF customers rely on these outdated meters.\n\nThe supplier is urging these customers to come forward and get a smart meter.\n\nAn EDF spokesperson said: \"We have been contacting customers to ensure they exchange their RTS meters as soon as possible ahead of the signal switch off date and have already upgraded thousands of RTS meters to ensure customers are not affected.\n\n\u201cWe still have many customers that require an upgrade and we urge all customers who have not yet engaged with us to contact us and book an exchange as soon as possible \u2013 it\u2019s easy to do and appointments are free of charge.\"\n\nAccording to data from Energy UK, approximately 530,000 customers are still dependent on RTS meters.\n\nSuppliers have been racing to move customers to smart meters before the deadline.\n\nOctopus Energy warned thousands of its own customers at the end of January.\n\nMeanwhile, E.ON Next urged 65,000 customers to take action to avoid being cut off.\n\nCustomers should act now as there is currently a shortage of smart meter appointments.\n\nSome households have been made to wait up to a year to get an appointment as demand has surged due to the impending RTS switch off and there is a shortage of qualified staff. \n\nAn investigation by The Sun has found a host of major energy suppliers have a lack of appointments in some areas.\n\nOthers cannot tell customers when they will be available.\n\nHow do I know if I have an RTS electricity meter?\n\nIt is quite easy to tell if you have a meter that relies on the RTS.\n\nThe old RTS-powered meters have a switch box labelled \u201cRadio Teleswitch\u201d located next to the physical electric meter.\n\nOthers may have the RTS switch box included within the electricity meter as a single box on the wall.\n\nIf you are not sure about the type of electricity meter in your home then call your supplier.\n\nThey should usually have this information to hand.\n\nRTS is also sometimes called dynamically teleswitched (DTS).\n\nWhat is the alternative to RTS?\n\nSmart meters offer the same features as RTS as they can record the different prices at different times of the day that are offered by Economy 7 tariffs.\n\nThey work using a digital signal and can also show your energy usage in real-time.\n\nThis can be helpful to reduce your use and can save you money.\n\nSmart meters are being rolled out by suppliers across the country.\n\nAround 36 million households have one but they are not fault-free.\n\nAround one in ten smart meters are thought to be not working and are stuck in \u201cdumb\u201d mode, according to recent data from industry regulator Ofgem.\n\nThis could be because their display is broken or they have trouble connecting to the network in some areas.\n\nMeanwhile, many first-generation smart meters have technology which is out of date.\n\nThis is unlikely to be an issue with smart meters that are installed now.\n\nEnergy suppliers should make an effort to fix smart meters that are not working.\n\nIf your smart meter is not working then you may need to take meter readings to ensure your bills are accurate.\n\nIf your smart meter monitor, which shows readings and usage, is less than 12 months old then it should be replaced or fixed for free by your energy supplier.\n\nYou can ask your supplier for a traditional meter instead of a smart one.\n\nBut smart meters are replacing them and your supplier is not obliged to give you one.\n\nCan I keep my RTS tariff?\n\nOfgem has told suppliers that they must take reasonable steps to ensure that customers are on like-for-like tariffs after moving to a smart meter.\n\nIf this is not possible they must work with the customer to agree an appropriate tariff.\n\nThere may be more smart meter-only tariffs available to some customers that could save them money.\n\nIf your supplier has not contacted you then you do not need to wait for them to do so.\n\nGet in touch with them now if you want to swap immediately.", "summary": "", "url":

foremost, it\u2019s an unbelievable achievement, 500 games.\n\n\u201cJames has been through a lot in his Rangers career, but one thing I\u2019ve always got with James is he never hides. He\u2019s puts himself out there to play.\n\n\u201cOn Wednesday night, when I moved him from his natural right-back position to centre-half, he was exceptional, a real leader. That\u2019s what I want from a captain.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a few good chats. He\u2019s an important player for me.\n\n\u201cTo reach 500 games, he deserves a lot of credit.\u201d\n\nTavernier has won every domestic honour and led Gers to a Euro final.\n\nBut he has also faced flak as Gers have operated in Celtic\u2019s shadow in all but one of his ten seasons at Ibrox.\n\nAsked about the criticism, Ferguson added: \u201cThat\u2019s part of playing at Rangers.\n\n\u201cWhen you lose and don\u2019t play well, it\u2019s generally the captain who gets it in the neck, but he\u2019s big enough to handle those situations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through it. It\u2019s not nice at times, but I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s the nature of the beast when you play here.\u201d\n\nTavernier will lead out Rangers against Motherwell at Ibrox, just under a decade on from his debut in a 6-2 Challenge Cup win over Hibs.\n\nTeam-mate Robin Propper said: \u201cIt\u2019s a big day for him \u2014 500 is a beautiful number.\n\n\u201cHe brings a lot to the team in the locker room. He also does a lot on the field.\n\n\u201cHe speaks to everybody. He\u2019s open-minded, he\u2019s a real captain in that.\n\n\u201cI can learn from him and the young guys can learn from him. He\u2019s a real leader in our squad who wants the best for the team.\u201d\n\nTav is my best buy\n\nThe man who signed Tavernier says there\u2019s nothing fake about his achievement.\n\nMark Warburton forked out less than \u00a3250,000 to lure the right-back and Martyn Waghorn from Wigan Athletic a decade ago.\n\nEx-boss Warbs says Tavernier deserves all the praise for his honesty and dedication over ten seasons in Scotland.\n\nWarburton told SunSport: \u201cTav is a great character. What you see is what you get, he\u2019s very genuine and very honest.\n\n\u201cTav deserves every plaudit for reaching 500 games for Rangers.\n\n\u201cNothing about him is an act, nothing is fake with Tav.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a top lad and he absolutely appreciates what it means to captain such a club.\n\n\u201cHe knows what\u2019s involved and what it takes to captain Rangers.\n\n\u201cHe knows the expectations, the demands and the role he has to play. He\u2019s had the best education and he gets it.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll quite rightly go down as one of the great Rangers players.\n\n\u201cWill he also go down as one of the best pound-for-pound signings? I hope so, that would be nice.\u201d\n\nGers were in the Championship when Warburton took Tavernier to Ibrox. He made an instant impact with a goal on his debut \u2014 a 6-2 Challenge Cup win over Hibs at Easter Road in July 2015.\n\nThey won the second-tier title and Challenge Cup in that first season together.\n\nTavernier has won every domestic honour, led Gers to the Europa League final and was inducted into their Hall of Fame.\n\nHe has scored 129 goals \u2014 a record for a defender \u2014 and his corner for Cyriel Dessers\u2019 first goal against Kilmarnock at Rugby Park on Wednesday night was his 140th assist.\n\nWarburton said: \u201cWe\u2019d watched Tav very closely and were very aware of his attacking prowess, his goals and his delivery and his pace as well.\n\n\u201cHe and Waghorn were the first two targets and, thankfully, both were landed for such a paltry sum of money. It was less than \u00a3250,000 for the pair of them and I was very pleased with that piece of business.\n\n\u201cWaghorn was tremendous. He scored 38 goals in that first season. People forget we had no money at that time. I get annoyed about it as we had a very tight budget.\n\n\u201cWe were signing players for next to nothing and paying them next to nothing.\n\n\u201cWe beat Celtic in a Scottish Cup semi-final with a team on a fraction of Celtic\u2019s wages.\n\n\u201cTav was a great bit of business. I\u2019m delighted to see how his career has unfolded.\u201d\n\nWarburton says Tavernier has devoted himself on and off the field to Gers. He\u2019s worked hard to stay fit for ten managers and rarely rocked the boat.\n\nFormer QPR, Brentford and Nottingham Forest boss Warburton said: \u201cTav used to sit and talk to Lee Wallace. Lee\u2019s a great man and was a great player for me and a great mentor for Tav.\n\n\u201cKenny Miller also played a tremendous part in Tav\u2019s development, both as a player and a human being.\n\n\u201cTav\u2019s availability to play has always been a massive thing. His injury record for training every day and playing every week is amazing. He\u2019s always there.\n\n\u201cYou need to be an incredible athlete to meet those demands.\n\n\u201cAt Rangers, you play so many games. You\u2019re in Europe, you\u2019re travelling, you\u2019re staying in hotels.\n\n\u201cHis body meets all those demands and he keeps himself in great shape.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a top-class athlete. He\u2019s had to work so hard to maintain those levels of performance that are the envy of so many.\u201d\n\nTavernier was inducted into the Hall of Fame alongside new Rangers goalie coach Allan McGregor and former captain Steven Davis two years ago.\n\nIt was two years after he\u2019d won the title and a season after winning the Scottish Cup and enduring the pain of Euro final defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt in Seville.\n\nHe scored the only goal of the Premier Sports Cup final against Aberdeen 15 months ago to complete a full set of domestic winner\u2019s medals.\n\nBut while Warburton recognises it has not always been plain sailing for the Yorkshireman, the criticism of Tavernier still rankles with him and gets him heated.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat has annoyed me is the criticism he\u2019s faced when he\u2019s had little dips in form.\n\n\u201cPeople have said derogatory and derisory things about him at times.\n\n\u201cThey have phoned me to speak about him and I won\u2019t say a bad word about the lad.\u201d\n\nUnlike many other high-profile figures in the game over the years, Tavernier has rarely sparked any off-field headlines during his time in Scotland.\n\nHe even declined to discuss his landmark 500th appearance for Gers before he runs out at Ibrox this afternoon.\n\nWarburton isn\u2019t at all surprised and added his own congratulations to the plaudits which will land at his door today.\n\nHe added: \u201cHe\u2019s just a big family man. He lives life quietly.\n\n\u201cHe likes a car, but so he should as he\u2019s a young guy enjoying his success. He\u2019s a top individual.\n\n\u201cHe could have moved for more money at times, but he chose to stay at Rangers.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to remain at a magnificent institution, a global brand of a football club.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t get a better stage than that.\u201d\n\nKeep up to date with ALL the latest news and transfers at the Scottish Sun football page", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/14416325/james-tavernier-rangers-500-games-tenth-manager-ferguson-warburton/", "image": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/tp-James-Tavernier-500-2802_COMP.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1500&h=1000&crop=1", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 09:32:37", "author": "Roger Hannah", "authors": ["Roger Hannah"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.721}, {"id": 295590044, "title": "World leaders back Zelensky after White House row with Trump \u2013 as Russia brands Ukrainian president an \u2018insolent pig\u2019", "text": "WORLD leaders have flocked around Volodymyr Zelensky in support after his furious, historic row with Donald Trump in the Oval Office.\n\nLeaders from the EU piled in to back Ukraine and blame Russia - which gleefully branded Zelensky an \"insolent pig\" after the clash. \n\nZelensky yesterday flew to Washington to sign a critical minerals deal, but was booted out of the White House early after a sensational scrap.\n\nTrump accused him of \"not wanting peace\" and \"gambling with World War Three\" as tensions flared.\n\nThe growing division threatens to destabilise the entire western alliance, but Europe has reacted by standing firm with Ukraine.\n\nKaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, even said that the \"free world needs a new leader\", after Trump degraded Ukraine's president with a bitter onslaught.\n\nKeir Starmer is the only leader who has spoken to both Trump and Zelensky since the feud.\n\nA No10 spokesperson said Friday evening: \"[Starmer] retains unwavering support for Ukraine, and is doing all he can to find a path forward to a lasting peace based on sovereignty and security for Ukraine.\"\n\nHe fell short of publicly criticising the US President over the clash.\n\nGerman chancellor Olaf Scholz posted on X: \u201cNobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians do. \n\n\"Therefore we are working on a common path to a lasting and just peace.

You are never alone.

Ararat girls basketball wins first state title", "text": "AUGUSTA \u2014 Cali Pomerleau brought the ball up the court as the final seconds ticked away in the Class A girls basketball championship game, then passed it over to Kennedy Lampert, the two looking at each other with joyous, almost disbelieving smiles.\n\nAfter a season spent as the team to beat, it was finally time for Mt. Ararat to celebrate.\n\nJulianna Allen scored 17 points and added 12 rebounds in a dominant showing, Lampert and Jenna Jensen added seven points apiece, and the Eagles won their first state title Friday night with a 43-31 victory over Hampden Academy at the Augusta Civic Center.\n\n\u201cIt feels amazing. I\u2019m kind of speechless,\u201d said Allen, whose play on both ends of the floor helped the Eagles take command of a two-point game in the second half. \u201c(There) definitely was a chip on the shoulder, especially after last year. We didn\u2019t want to come here just to lose, it\u2019s a bus ride home. We came here, coming to win.\u201d\n\nMt. Ararat (20-2) made program history last year by reaching its first Class A South final. After losing to rival Brunswick, but with all five starters returning, the determination to win it all set in well before the season\u2019s opening tip.\n\n\u201cWe followed through the process,\u201d said Pomerleau, a senior captain who scored five points. \u201cWe worked hard all season long, I\u2019m proud of all my teammates. It\u2019s such an amazing accomplishment. \u2026 I\u2019m just so happy. I can\u2019t express it.\u201d\n\nEve Wiles had eight points to lead the Broncos (16-6), who started three sophomores and had one senior, and who struggled against Mt. Ararat\u2019s pressure.\n\n\u201cIt just made it hard for us to get into a rhythm offensively,\u201d Hampden Academy coach Nick Winchester said. \u201cAnd even when we did get shots, they were so well defended and contested. We just had to work for everything.\u201d\n\nThat was the message all week, Lampert said.\n\n\u201cPressure, pressure, pressure, get up in their face and see where that leads us,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cPush them to the edge and kick them off.\u201d\n\nThe game, though, started at Hampden\u2019s preferred pace. Mt. Ararat led 14-12 after a low-scoring and methodical first half. That suited the Broncos, who had a height advantage but were worried about Mt. Ararat\u2019s quickness.\n\n\u201cI felt that game needed to be played in the high 30s, low 40s,\u201d Winchester said.\n\nThe Eagles had more turnovers (eight) than made baskets (six) in the first half.\n\n\u201cJitters, it\u2019s a big game, there\u2019s a lot on the line,\u201d Mt. Ararat coach Julie Petrie said. \u201cWe had a positive talk in the locker room and said \u2018Look, we\u2019re in good shape. We\u2019re not even playing our best game, and we\u2019re up. \u2026 We just need to play our game.'\u201d\n\nIn the second half, that meant a whole lot of the 6-foot-1 Allen, who used her height, length, quickness and footwork to take control. After Kayleigh Wagg (five points) scored the first three points of the third quarter for Mt. Ararat, Allen slipped inside for a layup and then had a step-through for a basket, making it 21-14.\n\n\u201cI knew when (Grace LaBree) wasn\u2019t in, it was a mismatch down low,\u201d Allen said. \u201cMy teammates did a good job getting me the ball, and I could go to work down there.\u201d\n\nHampden got a basket from LaBree and then a jumper from Wiles to pull within 25-21, prompting an Eagles timeout with 7:14 to play. But Allen again swung momentum back to Mt. Ararat. She spun inside for a layup, then had a steal two possessions later and finished in transition to put the Eagles ahead by eight.\n\nAllen scored eight of the Eagles\u2019 first 15 points of the second half.\n\n\u201cYou get a kid who\u2019s not only 6-1, but very comfortable with her left hand. She finished with her left probably half of those shots,\u201d Winchester said. \u201cI thought she took over the game in the third and asserted herself, and I thought that was the space, from a points standpoint, that they needed to stretch the game a little bit.\u201d\n\nHampden cut the deficit to 29-24 on an Aubrey Shaw 3-pointer with 4:38 to go but didn\u2019t score over the next 2:51. Mt. Ararat, meanwhile, sank 12 of 14 free throws after the Broncos narrowed the gap to five.\n\n\u201cWe love the foul line,\u201d Lampert said. \u201cWe practice, practice, practice them every day. We take at least 100 or more foul shots every practice.\u201d\n\nWith the Eagles calm and collected at the line, the final minute became a coronation.\n\n\u201cEvery coach says, \u2018They\u2019re the best team,\u2019 but they\u2019re real,\u201d Petrie said of her players. \u201cThey have the best chemistry, we love each other, we trust each other. They\u2019re coachable.

Yet it wasn\u2019t impossible as Falmouth rode one of the all-time greatest individual performances to the mountaintop.\n\nDavis Mann scored 43 points, and Falmouth roared back for a 70-60 win over Messalonskee in the Class A state championship game at the Augusta Civic Center. It was the ninth state championship for Falmouth, and its second in Class A (2016).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to be one of the top games ever, just because of the situation with being down and coming back,\u201d said Dave Halligan, who won his seventh Gold Ball as Falmouth\u2019s coach. \u201cYou tell kids, \u2018Never give up, never ever give up,\u2019 and they didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMann scored 18 points of Falmouth\u2019s 22 points in the fourth quarter, then added eight more in overtime. He finished three points shy of the Class A state final record set by Brunswick\u2019s Ralph Mims in 2004.\n\n\u201cIt feels pretty indescribable; it hasn\u2019t really set in yet,\u201d Mann said. \u201cI knew the ball was going (in the) hoop, and I knew I had to keep attacking all game and getting those open looks, not just for me but for my teammates.\u201d\n\nPowered by six early points from Mann, Falmouth (19-3) took a 9-5 lead to the second quarter. He then had another six-point burst early in the second quarter, and the Navigators held a 17-12 lead midway through the quarter.\n\nMessalonskee, though, would answer.\n\nLed by Ty Bernier (24 points), the Eagles (19-3) went on an 8-0 run to take the lead for the first time. Mann answered with a basket, but Messalonskee follow with another 8-0 spurt, this one highlighted by a Ryan Parent 3-pointer with 30 seconds left in the half.\n\n\u201cWe started off the game well, and then we got out of our game a little bit,\u201d Halligan said. \u201cI thought this was going to be a tough matchup just like it was. \u2026 I\u2019ve seen them play a couple times, and they\u2019re legit. They deserved to be here, and they gave us all we could handle.\u201d\n\nMessalonskee capped a 20-2 run early in the third quarter and led 32-19. The margin hovered around the 10-point mark for most of the quarter, until a three-point play from Mann with 0.4 seconds made it a seven-point game entering the fourth.\n\nMann opened the fourth quarter with another basket, but Bernier hit back-to-back 3-pointers to put the Eagles up 11. The Navigators again clawed back, but after two Drake Brunelle free throws with 1:43 remaining, Messalonskee led 51-43.\n\nYet after Jaxon Cameron cut the deficit to six, Falmouth\u2019s press forced a turnover that led to a Mann 3-pointer. Then, with 31 seconds left, Mann made a play bigger than any of his baskets \u2013 a perfect pass to David Graiver, who scored on a backdoor cut to tie the game at 54.\n\n\u201cI saw David open, and I knew his defender was coming to take the charge, so I just kind of hucked the pass over my shoulder,\u201d Mann said. \u201cI knew he was going to make it; I trust him fully for that.\u201d\n\nFalmouth rode the momentum into overtime, scoring the first eight points. With the score 64-58, the Navigators got two free throws and a basket from Mann to turn a once-daunting deficit into a double-digit lead.\n\nThe loss was a cruel way for Messalonskee to fall short of the first state title in program history. The Eagles led for nearly 19 minutes of game time \u2014 nearly all of it by multiple possessions \u2014 but key mistakes and turnovers down the stretch saw their championship dreams fade away.\n\n\u201cI think we played not to lose instead of playing to win, and we had some turnovers and missed free throws,\u201d said Messalonskee coach Sam Smith. \u201cWe had our chances, and we didn\u2019t convert, so credit to them. \u2026 I told (our players) that everyone should hold their heads high; things just didn\u2019t go our way tonight.\u201d\n\nFor Falmouth, though, it was a dream finish for 12 seniors. As freshmen and sophomores, they lost state finals to Nokomis and Brewer, respectively, the latter in heartbreaking fashion. Then, last year, they lost a stunner to Westbrook in their tournament opener.\n\nIt was why the Navigators refused to be denied this time, and why many years from now they\u2019ll be able to look back and say they won one of the all-time great games in Maine tournament history.\n\n\u201cWe lost freshman year and sophomore year and didn\u2019t get far last year, so this is all I could ever dream of,\u201d said Falmouth senior Billy Burks. \u201cSomehow, we got it done.\u201d", "summary": "Davis Mann (43 points) fuels a stunning comeback by the Navigators, who win in overtime after erasing an eight-point deficit late in regulation.", "url": "https://www.centralmaine.com/2025/02/28/falmouth-boys-basketball-rallies-past-messalonskee-in-class-a-final/", "image": "https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/02/41382674_20250228_A_BoysBasketball_3.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 04:36:50", "author": "Mike Mandell", "authors": ["Mike Mandell"], "language": "en", "category": "sports", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.121}, {"id": 295590002, "title": "\u2018I Would Love To Go to India\u2019: BLACKPINK\u2019s Lisa Expresses Desire To Meet Desi BLINKs, Shares Heartfelt Message for Fans With Release of Her Solo Debut Album \u2018Alter Ego\u2019 (Watch Video)", "text": "BLACKPINK's Lisa has set the internet abuzz as she released her highly anticipated debut solo studio album, \"Alter Ego\".

Uyghur Muslims are subjected to harsh religious persecution, forced labour, and mass incarceration as part of China's ongoing genocide. The Chinese government's unrelenting persecution of Uyghurs, even outside of its boundaries, is highlighted by the recent forced deportation of Uyghurs from Thailand, according to CFU.

They are penalized for refusal, made to eat throughout the day, and prohibited from fasting altogether. The remaining mosques have been converted into cafes, bars, and tourist attractions, erasing Uyghur religious identity. CFU noted that an estimated 16,000 mosques have been damaged or demolished. According to CFU, the government has called for the \"sinicization of Islam,\" stifling Uyghur voices and using their suffering for political purposes.\n\"As Muslims around the world observe Ramadan in prayer and reflection, Uyghur Muslims are imprisoned, enslaved in forced labor, and suffocated under relentless surveillance. Stripped of their religious freedom, they are banned from fasting, praying, or even identifying as Muslim while the Chinese regime brazenly continues its crimes against them. The global Muslim community and all defenders of human rights must stand together, demand justice, and take bold action to end the Uyghur genocide,\" said CFU Executive Director Rushan Abbas.

It has called on the world to raise the voices of Uyghurs, boycott goods associated with forced labour of Uyghur Muslims, and hold China responsible for its violations of human rights. CFU has invited supporters to donate to the Campaign for Uyghurs to strengthen advocacy efforts as they continue to work to bring an end to their suffering.

Not much more to say,\u201d Maine coach Ben Barr said of Makar. \u201cHe\u2019s playing the right way and getting rewarded for it.\u201d\n\nMaine improved to 20-6-5, giving the Black Bears back-to-back 20 win seasons for the first time in 18 years. The victory also solidified Maine\u2019s hold on second place in the Hockey East standings. The Black Bears have a five-point cushion over third-place Boston University and can clinch second place with a win Saturday against Vermont.\n\nThe hat trick, which included Makar\u2019s first two power-play goals of the season, gave him 10 goals in his last nine games. In three seasons at UMass, Makar scored a combined 15 goals. He has 16 goals this season, tied with Harrison Scott for the team lead.\n\n\u201cI tell him every game, he\u2019s due for a goal here. But he scores every game, so that doesn\u2019t really make sense,\u201d said Nolan Renwick, who has centered Makar\u2019s line most of the season. \u201cHe\u2019s been playing great. He\u2019s really come into his own as a power forward that has offensive upside but can play a physical game.\u201d\n\nThe 6-foot-3, 210-pound Makar is the younger brother of Cale Makar, the Norris Trophy-winning defenseman for the Colorado Avalanche and a Hobey Baker winner as college hockey\u2019s top player at UMass in 2019. Taylor transferred to Maine for his senior year after three seasons at UMass.\n\nMakar\u2019s 27 points are second on the team, behind Scott\u2019s 31. He said his hot streak is the result of moving his legs, and developing chemistry with Renwick and whoever has been on the line with them. Friday, it was Charlie Russell, who had the second assist on Makar\u2019s third goal.\n\n\u201cNothing happens without my linemates and the team, and obviously it\u2019s good to get that win,\u201d Makar said. \u201cJust playing hard, having a heavy stick, and trying to get the details down. Overall, just playing a good game.\u201d\n\nMakar\u2019s first goal was at 19:14 of the first period. Defenseman Frank Djurasevic faked a shot from the point and found Makar on the doorstep with a pass that Makar was able to tap past Vermont goalie Axel Mangbo.\n\nHis second goal came with the Black Bears on a 5-on-3 advantage midway through the second period, minutes after killing a 5-on-3 opportunity for the Catamounts. This time, Makar deflected Djuarasevic\u2019s shot for a 2-0 lead.\n\n\u201cGreat play by Frank on the first one. Great retrieval on the power play. Second one, it ended up hitting my shin pad and going in,\u201d said Makar, a native of Calgary, Alberta.\n\nMakar\u2019s third goal came midway through the third period, two minutes after Vermont\u2019s Isak Walther cut Maine\u2019s lead to 2-1. After Mangbo made a right pad save on a Brandon Chabrier shot, Makar was there to knock home the rebound.\n\n\u201cThat was the simplest play of the night. We win a battle in the corner, chip the puck to a guy in the neutral zone, (Charbier) had a great shot, put it on the far pad, and drive the net,\u201d Barr said. \u201cIt\u2019s the simplest hockey. You learn that when you\u2019re 10 years old. If you\u2019re really good at the simple things, usually good things will happen.\u201d\n\nMakar knew it was his first hat trick. When told he scored his first two power-play goals of the season, Makar was surprised.\n\n\u201cBetter late than never, I guess,\u201d he said.", "summary": "The senior transfer notches a hat trick in a 4-1 win, giving him 10 goals in his last nine games.", "url": "https://www.centralmaine.com/2025/02/28/taylor-makar-lifts-maine-mens-hockey-past-vermont/", "image": "https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/UMaine-logo-1704419226.jpeg?w=224", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 03:45:39", "author": "Travis Lazarczyk", "authors": ["Travis Lazarczyk"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.125}, {"id": 295589996, "title": "Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet Train Project: Ashwini Vaishnaw Says 360 Km of Bullet Train Project Complete; Blames Uddhav Thackeray for Delay", "text": "Ahmedabad, March 1: Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Saturday said that 360 km of the Bullet Train project has been completed, with significant progress on the Maharashtra section that got a setback due to a delay in permissions by the Uddhav Thackeray government. \"The Bullet Train project is progressing well, with 360 km completed and track laying underway...

List of Actions Than Can Invalidate Ramzan Fast.\n\"And nonetheless, for the last ten days and every engagement we've had with the Ukrainians, there's been complications in getting that point across, including the public statements that President Zelenskyy has made. But they insisted on coming to DC. This agreement could have been signed five days ago, but they insisted on coming to Washington. And it was a very and should have been a very clear understanding, don't come here and create a scenario where you're going to start lecturing us about how diplomacy isn't going to work. So, as President Zelenskyy took it in that direction and it ended in a predictable outcome as a result. It's unfortunate that was supposed to be this way, but that's the path he chose. And I think, frankly, you know, sends his country backwards in regards to achieving peace, which is what President Trump wants at the end of the day, is for this war to end. He's been as consistent as anyone can be about what his objective is here,\" he added.\nSpeaking to CNN, he said that the verbal clash between the leaders started after Zelenskyy asked Vance on what kind of diplomacy they are talking about. Rubio said the meeting went \"off the rails\" after that interaction.\nAsked on what does he want to see Zelenskyy apologise for, Rubio stated, \"Well, apologize for turning this thing into the fiasco for him that it became. There was no need for him to go in there and become antagonistic. Look, this thing went off the rails. You were there, I believe it went off the rails when he said, let me ask you a question to the vice president, What kind of diplomacy are you talking about? Well, this this is a serious thing. I mean, thousands of people have been killed. Thousands and he talks about all these horrible things that have happened to prisoners of war and children. All true, all bad. This is what we're dealing with here. It needs to come to an end. We are trying to bring it to an end.\"\n\"The way you bring it to an end is you get Russia to the table to talk, and he understands that attacking Putin, no matter how anyone may feel about him personally, forcing the president into a position where you're trying to go to him into attacking Putin, calling him names, maximalist demands about Russia having to pay for the reconstruction, all the sorts of things that you talk about in a negotiation when you start talking about that aggressively and the president's a dealmaker. He's made deals his entire life. You're not going to get people to the table. And so you start to perceive that maybe Zelenskyy doesn't want a peace deal. He says he does, but maybe he doesn't and that active open undermining of efforts to bring about peace is deeply frustrating for everyone who's been involved in communications with them leading up to today. And I think the campaign for wasting our time for a meeting that was going to end the way it did,\" he added. The Oval Office meeting began with warm exchanges and handshakes, with Trump at one point saying of Zelensky: \"I think he's a great guy.\" But matters took an ugly turn after Zelensky attempted to explain Russian President Vladimir Putin's lack of diplomacy to Vance in a heated confrontation in front of live cameras and journalists.\nUS Vice President accused Zelenskyy of \"litigating\" in front of the world's press, criticized him for taking part in photo-ops with Democrats during the 2024 campaign, and said his remarks were \"disrespectful\" to the administration.\nRaising his voice, Trump called the Ukrainian president \"disrespectful\" and told him he should be thanking the US, saying, \"You don't have the cards.\" \"You are either going to make a deal or we're out and if we are out, you will fight it out. I don't think it's going to be pretty,\" he added.\nTrump and Zelensky were set to sign a deal that would have created a joint US-Ukraine fund investing in extracting the country's rare-earth mineral supply. Friday's meeting was supposed to ink a deal on rare earth minerals which are used to make a variety of tech products.

Howells has already lost a high court case to allow him to search the tip for the hard drive, which he believes contains bitcoin worth 600 million pounds. Also Read | US Bankruptcy Court Rules Against Byju's Parent Think & Learn, Riju Ravindran and Hedge Fund Camshaft Capital Finding Guilty of Fraudulent Transfer of USD 533 Million, 'Breach of Fiduciary Duty'. But would it even be possible to find it? Let's do the maths. Howells, a Welsh IT engineer, was an early adopter of the cryptocurrency bitcoin in December 2008. By February 2009, he had started mining the coins on his laptop \u2013 a process which involves using your computer to carry out complex mathematical processes in exchange for the coins. Also Read | Ramadan 2025 Fasting Rules: Is Smoking Allowed While Fasting? Does Period Break Your Fast? List of Actions Than Can Invalidate Ramzan Fast. At the time, he was one of just five people mining the currency, and he eventually accrued a fortune of around 8,000 bitcoin. Initially, these were basically worthless \u2013 the first real-world transaction involving the currency was in 2010, when a man in Florida bought two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins. However, in the 15 years since, the value of the currency has grown dramatically, with a single bitcoin passing the USD 100,000 mark in December 2024 \u2013 a value which would mean those two pizzas are now worth USD 1 billion (790 million pound). Doing the calculations No wonder Howells wants to find his hard drive. But what are the chances of finding a tiny 10cm hard drive in a site containing 1.4 billion kg of waste? Is it literally like finding a needle in a haystack? At first, this seems like a simple calculation. If we randomly select a single location within the landfill, the probability that the hard drive will be there is simply the size of the object divided by the total size of the landfill. A Google maps estimate of the area of the Docksway landfill site suggests it is roughly 500,000 square metres (or 5 billion square centimetres), which is approximately the size of 70 football pitches. However, we also have to account for the depth of the landfill, with years of rubbish piled on top of each other. Even a conservative estimate of 20 metres would give a total volume of 10 million cubic metres (or 10 trillion cubic centimetres). This is roughly 3,600 times the volume of the swimming pool used at last summer's Paris Olympic Games. Howells says the bitcoin are on a 2.5-inch hard drive, which has a volume of around 70 cubic centimetres (7cm x 10cm x 1cm). Therefore, the odds of finding the bitcoin at a single randomly selected location are 70/10,000,000,000,000 = 0.000000000007 \u2013 approximately a one in 143 billion chance. This is over 3,000 times less likely than winning the jackpot on the UK's National Lottery. However, with \u00a3600 million on the line, it seems unlikely anyone would just turn up and search one single location. So, the real question here is about time and money. If we know that the hard drive is located somewhere within the landfill site, how long would it take to find it, and how much would it cost? If we focus on time to begin with, this is really just an extension of our first calculation. Suppose it takes 1 second to search each 1,000 cubic centimetre section of the landfill (an incomplete estimate since my experience of hunting landfill for hard drives is limited), then it would take us 10 billion seconds (or 316 years) of continuous searching to cover the entire site. But of course, this could be significantly reduced by having an entire team searching at the same time. Is it financially worth it? Clearly, Howells does not have 316 years available to complete his search, but what if he was given the resources for one full year of non-stop searching? The odds of finding the hard drive in this year would be 1 in 316, and while the chances remain slim, this might start to sound tempting given the potential reward. That is where the aspect of cost comes in. How much would you be willing to pay in order to have a 1 in 316 chance of winning 600 million pound? The answer lies in the statistical concept of \u201cexpected value\u201d, which is the expected long-term outcome of a scenario if you were able to repeat it over and over again. For example, suppose you were rolling a die, and you were told that you would be given 2 pounds if you rolled a six but would have to pay 1 pound if you rolled any other value. You can work out the expected value of this game to see if it is worth playing. The odds of rolling a 6 are 1/6, and the odds of rolling any other value are 5/6. We can therefore compute the expected value as: E [winnings] = 1/6 * \u00a32 + 5/6 * (-\u00a31) = 2/6 - 5/6 = -3/6 = -\u00a31/2 In other words, you would expect to lose half of \u00a31 (or 50p), on average, every time you played this game. In the case of our bitcoins, we can think about the expected value as being the amount of money you would expect to make on average if you searched the landfill for a whole year. We would expect that, on average, we would find the hard drive (and the 600 million pound) 1 time out of 316, and would fail to find it 315 times out of 316 and get absolutely nothing. Therefore, we can compute the expected value as: E [\u00a3 found] = 1/316 * \u00a3600m + 315/316 * 0 = \u00a31,898,734 This means that on average, by searching the site for a year, you would expect to find 1.9 million pounds. So, if the searching costs were less than this amount, you would expect to make a profit on average, and it may be considered a worthwhile investment. However, if the search cost more than 1.9 million pounds, you would expect to lose money on average, and it would not be considered worthwhile. These calculations can be easily adjusted to account for different lengths of search time, number of people searching, or indeed different sizes of landfill site or search area. If Howell ever gets access to the dump, it might be worth having a statistician on hand to help guide the search (and of course, I would be happy to offer my services for a small fee\u2026).

Many people are aware of the importance of protein in the diets, but are not always sure about exactly how to achieve that and the specifics of the role it plays in the diet.\nAlso Read | Mumbai City vs Mohun Bagan, ISL 2024-25 Live Streaming Online on JioCinema: Watch Telecast of MCFC vs MBSG Match in Indian Super League 11 on TV and Online.\nProtein is an important nutrient for body and mind, supporting tissue building, hormone and enzyme production, and overall metabolism. Research shows that high-protein diets not only aid in fat loss but also help preserve lean muscle and prevent weight regain. This makes protein a key ingredient for effective and sustainable weight management.\nEven while resting, muscle tissue burns three times more energy than body fat. This means the muscles are powerful calorie-burning machines. For many, the goal is building and maintaining muscle mass to achieve a healthier, stronger body.\nAlso Read | WWE SmackDown Results Tonight, February 28: Trish Stratus, Cody Rhodes Make Appearances, Liv Morgan and Team Beat Bianca Belair and Team; LA Knight Becomes US Championship Contender, and Other Exciting Matches on WWE Friday Night SmackDown Ahead of Elimination Chamber 2025 .\nHowever, for those focusing on losing weight, it can mean losing not just fat but also muscle mass. That's where protein, paired with exercise, becomes the ultimate ally. High-protein diets and regular exercise work together and can safeguard the muscle mass during weight loss, keeping the metabolism running strong.\nDietitian - Nutritionist Florencia Braga, Senior Manager, Scientific Affairs - EMEA at Herbalife, outlines four top tips for building and maintaining muscle mass through the power of protein:\n1. Protein Needs Change with Age\n* As people age, the body's ability to process protein declines, necessitating a higher intake to maintain muscle mass and overall health. Older adults should aim for 1.0-1.2 grams of protein per kg of body weight per day to support muscles and health, higher amounts could be needed to support the needs of physically active older adults or for particular health conditions.\n2. Don't Underestimate the Power of Plant Protein\n* A plant-based diet with a well-balanced mixture of plant proteins can provide a complete, high-quality protein source. For example, soy protein has the same quality as whey or milk proteins measured by PDCAAS (Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score).\n* However, the protein intake recommendations for vegans and vegetarians is about 10% higher than those whose diets contain animal protein. Products such as Herbalife's Personalized Protein Powder help support peoples' daily protein needs in a plant-based diet.\n3. Consider Milk Proteins for Muscle Growth\n* Milk proteins, whey and casein, are probably the most studied proteins in relation to exercise and their potential to help build and maintain muscle. Consuming high-quality proteins like the ones found in milk is an excellent way to support muscle growth and recovery from exercise. If dairy is not the preferred option, make sure to choose proteins that deliver all essential amino acids in sufficient quantities.\n4. Boost Protein Intake with Supplements * Getting sufficient protein is not the only challenge. Studies have shown that having an even protein distribution throughout the day better supports muscle synthesis than skews intakes. Aim to have 20-40g of protein per meal (depending on the daily needs). This might be challenging from some meals of the day, particularly breakfast. Protein supplements can help one achieve a healthy and ideal protein intake that is evenly distributed throughout the day. Dietitian - Nutritionist Florencia Braga, Senior Manager, Scientific Affairs - EMEA at Herbalife says:\n\"Protein is a cornerstone of overall health, especially when it comes to building and maintaining muscle mass. As we focus on fitness goals, it's crucial to ensure we're meeting our protein needs in terms of total amount, intake daily distribution and sources to support muscle growth, weight management, and heart health. Whether from food or nutrition supplements, protein is a key factor in achieving a healthier, stronger body.\n\"At Herbalife, we understand the importance of high-quality protein in your wellness journey. That's why we offer products that can enhance your protein intake - with vegan options also available. Whether wanting to lose weight, gain muscle or maintain muscle, the important thing is that none of these things can be done in isolation, it takes a healthy balanced diet and lifestyle with protein just one part of the overall puzzle.\"\nAbout Herbalife Ltd.\nHerbalife (NYSE: HLF) is a premier health and wellness company and community that has been changing people's lives with great nutrition products and a business opportunity for its independent distributors since 1980.

They end it that way, too, God willing. But, when the rest of the government is gathered together for a big event, like President Donald Trump's joint congressional address Tuesday night, a designated survivor is kept away to ensure someone in the line of presidential succession stays alive.

Picking a failsafe in case of a cataclysmic event that wipes out everyone else dates back to the Cold War. It's been dramatized in novels and an ABC series starring Kiefer Sutherland that aired from 2016 to 2019. Being the actual designated survivor brings extra adrenaline jolts and humbling thoughts about being unwittingly catapulted into the presidency and unthinkable tragedy \u2014 though the minute-to-minute details usually don't feature the high drama of fictional portrayals, those who have filled the role say. Also Read | Ramadan 2025 Fasting Rules: Is Smoking Allowed While Fasting? Does Period Break Your Fast? List of Actions Than Can Invalidate Ramzan Fast. \u201cIt focuses your mind. It also enhances your prayer that it doesn't happen to you,\u201d James Nicholson, who was President George W. Bush's veterans affairs secretary and designated survivor during the 2006 State of the Union, said of possibly becoming president after a cataclysmic event. Trump's White House hasn't said who will be the designated survivor choice Tuesday. Historian and journalist Garrett M. Graff said the concept of designated survivor has long captivated people because it combines the public's inherent fascination with danger and the romance of an \u201ceveryman\u201d being thrust into the presidency. \u201cThe idea of, you're just a random Cabinet official, and then something terrible happens and, all of a sudden, you're president of the United States,\" said Graff, author of \u201cRaven Rock: The Story of the US Government's Secret Plan to Save Itself \u2014 While the Rest of Us Die.\u201d Until the September 11, 2001, attacks, designated survivors had more control over where they went outside Washington. President Bill Clinton's energy secretary, the late Bill Richardson, was picked in 2000 and simply moved up a planned weekend trip with his wife to Oxford, Maryland, a waterfront town about 80 miles away, so he'd be there during the State of the Union. When Dan Glickman, Clinton's agriculture secretary, was tapped during the 1997 State of the Union, his hometown of Wichita, Kansas, was too far away, so he chose New York, where his daughter lived. \u201cI thought it was kind of exciting. But I wasn't hyped up from a dangerous perspective,\u201d Glickman said. \u201cI don't even think anybody told me to be careful.\u201d Alberto Gonzales, Bush's attorney general, was the designated survivor during the 2007 State of the Union. He said White House chief of staff Josh Bolten called a few days before and gave a couple of options for where he could hunker down. Gonzales chose to be in flight, and he arrived at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland to find \u201cmembers of every major department and agency\u201d there to ride with him. They carried thick binders stuffed with memos and protocol instructions, just in case. He said there were a series of briefings that may have stretched right into Bush's speech, which he watched from the air. \u201cIt was during that time that it sort of suddenly hit me, if something happened in the Capitol and everyone's killed, that I'd be president,\u201d Gonzales said. \"It's sort of sobering. And you wonder, would I be up to governing a wounded nation?\u201d In \u201cRaven Rock\u201d, Graff details how the designated survivor concept was formalized by the Carter and Reagan administrations amid fears that Soviet subs just off the Atlantic Coast could fire nuclear missiles and wipe out Washington with barely 10 minutes' warning. Beginning in April 1980, the White House Military Office tasked the Federal Emergency Management Agency with ensuring succession. An aide was directed to recommend to the president who should skip events when all possible successors were together outside the White House. Officials still prepare for a massive attack or disaster. The military helicopter that collided with a regional jet outside Reagan National Airport in January was on a continuity of government mission \u2014 training to keep the federal government functioning in case of catastrophe. The first time that a Cabinet member being kept away from a presidential speech to Congress was publicly divulged was President Ronald Reagan's Education Secretary Terrel Bell in 1981. But Bell wasn't identified until afterward. Today, TV images from the House chamber allow political junkies to spot the missing Cabinet member within minutes. Nicholson said Bush's then-chief of staff, Andy Card, had asked him a few weeks before the State of the Union to take on the role. He was a natural fit given that his agency played an important role in continuity of government exercises due to its numerous hospitals and clinics nationwide. Nicholson flew by helicopter to a destination only divulged once he was in the air, and later sat in a command centre, where he underwent briefings before watching Bush's speech. He was served a \u201cwonderful\u201d dinner, prepared onsite by personnel from the White House mess, though he can't recall if it was T-bone steak or prime rib or something similar. \u201cIt made you think that, at least, if this awful thing happened, you'd be well fed,\" he said. \u201cThe enormity of that job. You think about, remote as it is, this is something you might have to do,\u201d he said of becoming president. Nicholson's wife was attending the State of the Union, meaning that if something happened, she could be among the victims, which only added to the pressure. When it was over, Nicholson wasn't asked to fill in his predecessor in the role, Gonzales, or future designated survivors. \u201cWe don't have a club,\u201d he laughed. \"We should.\u201d Glickman recalls boarding an Air Force G-3 from Andrews along with Secret Service agents, a military official and a series of advisers not on his usual staff. A three-car motorcade later carried him from LaGuardia Airport to his daughter's apartment near Union Square in Manhattan. She wanted to invite others to watch the speech with them, but Glickman nixed that. \u201cThis was not a party,\" he said. It wasn't all serious, though. Glickman said he was told he didn't need to dress up, so he didn't wear a suit. Instructions not to study up spared him from reading briefing books or memorising security protocols.

Pant has not been a part of the playing XI in the last two group games, with India handing over the wicket-keeping duties to KL Rahul, who has performed remarkably well behind the stumps and provided solidity to the middle order.

He didn't get many chances... we've got to keep Rishabh up and running. We never know when we're going to need him.

Doeschate admitted that Sunday's match against New Zealand could be a contest of spin between the two sides. \"...they (New Zealand) have four spinners as well, so it could be a contest of spin. Coming into the competition, we weren't expecting such an over-reliance on spin. \"But the guys have bowled nicely and the pitch has helped a little bit, so I'm sure it's going to be the same for the next game here tomorrow.\" The South Africa-born former Dutch cricketer hinted that the team might ring in some changes in the bowling attack for its last group match against New Zealand. At the same time, Doeschate said the side would not compromise on the balance as it also wants to top the group with an all-win preliminary campaign. New Zealand have also already qualified for the semifinals after two wins and Sunday's match will decide the Group A topper. \"We've had two pretty tough training sessions, so that's been the preparation. In terms of the bench strength, I think the priority is making sure that we have our best guys available and fully fit for the second game (semifinal on March 4),\" Doeschate said. \"But we also don't want to rest them for another two days. So to get that balance right, we might just try to share the bowling out a little bit. But we obviously want to win against New Zealand as well. \"It's important that we keep that momentum going. And obviously to top the group as well. So the balance of those two things I just mentioned for the selection to be thought about,\" he added. Asked about captain Rohit Sharma's fitness after an injury scare in the game against Pakistan, he said, \"He's all right. You can see he's batting a little bit further than earlier. It's an injury he's had before, so he knows how to manage it really well.\" On whether scoring has been difficult on the pitch here, he said, \"I won't say difficult. I think we've become used to a standard where you score 320 without thinking too much about it. So getting to 320 has been difficult. \"The pitch has played slightly differently, in my opinion, in those two games. But there are probably like 280-290 pitches if you batter really well. So in the bigger picture, yeah, it's not like playing in Pakistan, where you expect to get 320-330. \"But you've got to adapt yourself and get a score that's good on these wickets. And we think it's right about 280-290, judging on the first two pitches.\" The India assistant coach also said that he is happy with the amount of rest his players have got since their last game against Pakistan on February 23. \"They've had a lot of rest now. But it's how you back the two games up. So if all the seamers are going to bowl 10 overs, and then say we bowl second in the first game, we're bowling 36 hours later, we're bowling first, that's quite a workload. \"So that's what I was alluding to. One of the options is to make sure the guys don't bowl their full quota of overs, if that opportunity allows itself.

Abraham has hits in varied genres whether it is high-octane actioners like \u201cDhoom\u201d, \u201cRace 2\u201d, \u201cSatyameva Jayate\u201d, \u201cDishoom\u201d, and \u201cPathaan\u201d; comedies such as \u201cGaram Masala\u201d, \u201cDostana\u201d, \u201cHousefull 2\u201d or dramas like \"Water\", \u201cNo Smoking\u201d, \u201cNew York\u201d, \u201cMadras Caf\u00e9\u201d, \u201cParmanu\u201d, and \u201cVedaa\u201d.

The actor, whose next release \"The Diplomat\" is inspired by true incidents, said the film will, hopefully, resonate with viewers in the brightest way possible. \"People have, in the past, said that \u2018Parmanu' marked my 1.0 version because I'd disappeared for four years. These are obituaries that are written every day about me, and it's fine, I don't have a problem with it. My career has been built on criticism, I enjoy it,\u201d Abraham told PTI in an interview. Also Read | Lupita Nyong'o Birthday: A Dazzling Trendsetter Redefining Red Carpet Glamour with Every Appearance. \"The only thing that's kept me going in this is my audience. People in the trade, producers, critics they all judge you by numbers and I get all that, and I respect that. That's business. But the only people that have kept me going and have made me survive is my audience. And I made 'The Diplomat' for that audience,\" he added. The film industry had a terrible year in terms of box office and Abraham believes it is now important to focus on the basics that make any story click with the audience and that's writing. \u201cMy vision as a producer and as an actor is just to create good stories and reach out to a wider audience. Do I want the numbers? I want the Rs 100 crore, 200s, 300s and the 400 crores. We all want that, but we want that with good stories. That's the difference. \u201cWe as an audience and trade are putting too much stress into the bifurcation of how the money is being spent. We've to cut all this noise, go back to writing, go back to where we started from and why we wanted to make films.\" Admitting that he also has been \u201cguilty\u201d of prioritising box office, Abraham said he now recognises the significance of well-crafted stories. Citing the example of \u201cThe Diplomat\u201d, the actor said it's important that the movie, directed by Shivam Nair of \u201cNaam Shabana\u201d and \u201cSpecial Ops\u201d, attains commercial success as that will empower him and his team to continue making such films. Inspired by true events, the film features Abraham in the role of diplomat JP Singh, who steps in to rescue an Indian woman named Uzma (Sadia Khateeb of \u2018Raksha Bandhan' fame) from Pakistan. The actor said he was captivated by the script of \u201cThe Diplomat\u201d from the first reading. \u201cI love geopolitics, so I thought this looks interesting, and I fell in love with what I read, credit to Ritesh Shah (writer). For me, it's about the story; it's immaterial whether you see a woman or a man in front. If the painting is beautiful, all the characters look beautiful,\u201d the actor said. One of the film's standout themes is the challenges faced by women in society, and Abraham said more awareness is needed to bring a change. \u201cWomen, children and animals are not safe in India. I've said this before, and I'll keep repeating it, till someone hears it. Children and animals are not safe because there aren't too many laws. With regards to women, you need to have strict laws. I'm not a law expert, so I'm not going to get into it. \"You go to the Middle East, Dubai, women are safe. There must be some reason why they are safe there and are not here. It stems out of education and awareness, there is a multi-pronged approach. We are a developing society; we will get there, but it will take us some time. But along the way, there is going to be a lot of collateral damage, and you see it every day.\u201d Preparing for the role of JP Singh required Abraham to immerse himself in the character, for which he said he undertook training from actor and acting coach Saurabh Sachdeva, known for his role in \u201cAnimal\u201d. \u201cShivam put me through a drill. We went through reading with the entire cast of this film. Then, I took a break and met Saurabh Sachdeva, who coached me on this character. For three weeks, I was with Saurabh every day,\u201d he said, adding that he and Sachdeva met JP Singh to portray his body language and mannerism correctly. \u201cThe Diplomat\u201d is produced by Abraham's JA Entertainment along with T-Series, Vipul D Shah, Ashwin Varde, Rajesh Bahl of Wakaoo Films, Sameer Dixit and Jatish Varma of Fortune Pictures and Rakesh Dang of Seeta Films. The film is scheduled to be released in theatres on March 14.

A win in their last league match will help India top the Group A. But that position of pride is of little value because they are set to face either Australia or most likely South Africa in the last four, and both of them have handy spin units at their disposal.

Indian batters have not been really comfortable against spin despite two victories thus far in the event, and New Zealand, who are also qualified for the semifinals, could offer them a tough challenge. The star Indian batters were focusing more on playing out Bangladesh spinners Mehidy Hasan Miraz (0/37) and Rishad Hossain (2/38) without taking risks, and they followed the same approach against Pakistan leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed (1/28). Also Read | India vs New Zealand ICC Champions Trophy History: A Look at Past Results, Records and Top Performers of IND vs NZ Matches Ahead of Mega Match in CT 2025. But they will come up against more wily customers in Mitchell Santner and Michael Bracewell on Sunday, and it could be their harshest test against spin yet in this event. Both the Kiwi spinners are in fine fettle here, and could be even more effective on the worn out surface at Dubai. Indian batters have been clever enough to milk spinners for singles and twos, while reserving the big shots against pacers when the ball came much more quickly and predictably at them. But they will face 20 overs from Santner and Bracewell while a few more of Glenn Phillips' part-time off-spin. India do not have very fond memories of facing Santner and Phillips in a Test series at home late last year, which they lost 0-3, and now they have Bracewell too to tackle. The off-spinner has been quite parsimonious so far, conceding just 3.2 runs per over across two matches. So, the effectiveness of Shubman Gill, India's standout batter in ODIs of late, batting icon Virat Kohli, who made a morale-boosting 100 against Pakistan, Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul against them will have a telling impact on the outcome of the game. And even beyond this match, considering the slowing-down nature of the decks at the DICS. Spinners to the fore ============== But there is a pleasing side to spinners' dominance here. The selection of five spinners \u2014 Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, Washington Sundar \u2014 was not viewed with any conviction ahead of the marquee event because of the overwhelming success pacers had at this venue in the past. But what India encountered at Dubai are tired pitches after the venue hosted the ILT20 recently, vindicating the selection call to a large extent. The three tweakers India employed so far \u2014 Jadeja, Axar and Kuldeep \u2014 have bowled as per the conditions, making it tough for their opponents. They have not produced any magical spells but were able to keep the opposition batters in check in the middle overs, as none of them have given in excess of five runs per over in this event. The match against Pakistan stands as a prime example for this. Despite constructing a 100-plus stand Mohammad Rizwan and Saud Shakeel were never able to accelerate between the 11th and 34th over \u2014 a phase when Indian spinners applied the brakes remarkably well. In fact, the Pakistan batters could not find a boundary for nine overs on the trot. But they might just face a different scenario against New Zealand as batters such as Kane Williamson, Will Young, Tom Latham, Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra etc are excellent against spin. If the Indian spinners can contain them, then it will do a world of good to their already high confidence. Chance for fringe players? ================ While India would want to sustain the momentum, they will think of giving skipper Rohit Sharma and Mohammed Shami some more time to hit the peak ahead of the semifinals. Rohit had experienced some discomfort during the match against Pakistan and stayed away from the field for some 20 minutes before returning. He batted too without any obvious struggle. But with no tournament riders hanging on this match, the management will be tempted to give Rohit a break. If that is the case, Rishabh Pant may get his first match here. There will also be discussion on resting Mohammed Shami because he had struggled with his calf during the match against Pakistan, and the think tank might just give him an extended recovery break ahead of the semis on March 4. Hence, Arshdeep Singh could come in for Shami, and the in-form Chakravarthy might replace Kuldeep as he is also coming off an injury lay-off. Teams (from): India: Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohd. Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Ravindra Jadeja, Varun Chakaravarthy. New Zealand: Mitchell Santner (c), Michael Bracewell, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway, Lockie Ferguson, Matt Henry, Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell, Will O'Rourke, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Nathan Smith, Kane Williamson, Will Young, Jacob Duffy.

It also stressed the profound ways Trump feels emboldened to redirect US foreign policy priorities toward his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda in ways that extend well beyond those of his tumultuous first term. The sudden blowup was the most heated public exchange of words between world leaders in the Oval Office in memory, as the usual staid work of diplomacy descended into finger-pointing, shouting and eye-rolling.

The encounter left the future of the US-Ukraine relationship, and Kyiv's ability to defend itself in the brutal conflict with Russia, in mortal jeopardy. \u201cYou either make a deal or we are out,\u201d Trump told Zelenskyy, underscoring the American leader's plans to dictate a swift end to the war or leave its longtime ally to continue the fight without its strongest backer. The stunning episode capped a week of what turned out to be largely futile efforts by US allies to paper over differences between Washington and Kyiv and to try to steer Trump away from his flirtations with Moscow. On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron huddled with Trump to lay the groundwork for an eventual European-led peacekeeping force in Ukraine aimed at deterring future Russian aggression and to encourage the US president to be more sceptical of Vladimir Putin. But even as Trump and Macron greeted each other with a vise-like grip, the US was splitting with its European allies at the United Nations by refusing to blame Russia for its invasion of Ukraine in a series of resolutions marking the three-year anniversary of the war. On Thursday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited Washington and appealed to Trump for a US \u201cbackstop\u201d for European nations who would provide front-line security for Ukraine. He was in essence looking for insurance that, should a peace deal be reached, Russia won't restart the fighting in the future. Starmer brought flattery and a state visit invitation from King Charles III to soften the ask. The approach seemed to work, as Trump struck a more conciliatory tone toward Ukraine, calling America's support for the country against Russia's invasion \u201ca very worthy thing to do\u201d and disclaiming any memory that he had called the Ukrainian leader a \u201cdictator\u201d. But Trump also brushed aside Putin's past broken diplomatic promises, claiming they occurred under different presidents, and saying the Russian leader had never violated a commitment to him. It came as his aides were planning a series of negotiating sessions with Russian officials to lay the groundwork for a potential meeting between Trump and Putin in the coming weeks. All the while, Trump was focused on securing a financial stake in Ukraine's critical minerals to recoup the tens of billions the U.S. has given to Kyiv to defend itself. Zelenskyy, meanwhile, wanted more than Washington's vague promises that the US would work to preserve its economic interest in Ukraine under the agreement and pushed for more concrete security guarantees. But Trump would not budge, and US officials repeatedly said Zelenskyy would not be welcome to meet with the president to discuss Trump's push for negotiations with Russia until it was signed. After weeks of browbeating, Zelenskyy's government on Wednesday formally agreed to the proposal, clearing the path for Friday's meeting. It started off cordially enough, as Trump and Zelenskyy spoke politely, even with admiration, of one of another for the first half-hour of the meeting. Trump even suggested he would continue some military assistance to Ukraine until he could secure an enduring peace deal with Russia. But when the Ukrainian leader raised alarm about trusting any promises from Putin to end the fighting, Vice President JD Vance rebuked him for airing disagreements with Trump in public. It instantly shifted the tenor of the conversation. Zelenskyy grew defensive, and Trump and his vice president blasted him as ungrateful and \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and issued stark warnings about future American support. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, both a defense hawk and a strident ally of Trump's, said he had warned Zelenskyy ahead of the meeting \u201cnot to take the bait\u201d in his dealings with Trump, who has repeatedly shown a penchant for throwing criticism but a deep resistance to receiving it. It was Vance \u2014 a longtime critic of American support for Ukraine \u2014 who dangled it, when he insisted diplomacy was the only pathway forward. \u201cWhat kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about?\u201d Zelenskyy said, listing Russia's past violations of ceasefires. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cI'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country,\u201d Vance responded before tearing into the Ukrainian leader. \u201cPresident, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.\u201d Trump then let loose, warning the Ukrainian leader, \u201cYou're gambling with World War III, and what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that's backed you far more than a lot of people say they should have.\u201d At another point, Trump declared himself \u201cin the middle\u201d, seeming to formally break from years of American support for Ukraine. He went on to deride Zelenskyy's \u201chatred\u201d for Putin as a roadblock to peace. \u201cYou see the hatred he's got for Putin,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat's very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hate.\u201d \u201cIt's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,\u201d Trump said to Zelenskyy as the two leaders talked over each other. The episode was just the latest instance of Trump's brazen moves to shift long-held American policy positions in his first six weeks back in office, portending even more uncertainty ahead for longtime American allies and partners who have already felt pressed to justify their place in Trump's eyes. It comes just weeks after Trump floated a permanent relocation of Palestinians in Gaza and an American takeover of the territory, and as he has doubled down on plans to put stiff tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada starting next week. After the Oval Office dustup, Zelenskyy was asked to leave the White House by top Trump advisers \u2014 scrapping plans for a lunch, a joint press conference and the signing of the economic agreement, even as the Ukrainian leader and his aides pushed for a \u201creset\u201d on the meeting. Trump later told reporters he didn't want to \u201cembolden\u201d the Ukrainian leader if he didn't want \u201cpeace\u201d with Russia \u2014 flipping what Ukraine had seen as an inducement for security guarantees into a cudgel. \u201cYou can't embolden somebody who does not have the cards,\u201d Trump said. After the disastrous encounter, Zelenskyy appeared on Fox News on Friday evening and told Bret Baier that his public spat with Trump and Vance was \u201cnot good for both sides\u201d. But Zelenskyy said Trump \u2014 who insists Putin is ready to end the three-year grinding war \u2014 needs to understand that Ukraine can't change its attitudes toward Russia on a dime. Zelenskyy added that Ukraine won't enter peace talks with Russia until it has security guarantees against another offensive. \u201cEverybody (is) afraid Putin will come back tomorrow,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cWe want just and lasting peace.\u201d \u201cIt's so sensitive for our people,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cAnd they just want to hear that America (is) on our side, that America will stay with us. Not with Russia, with us. That's it.\u201d Zelenskyy acknowledged that without US support, his country's position would grow \u201cdifficult\u201d. After repeatedly declining opportunities to apologise to Trump, Zelensky closed his Fox appearance with a sheepish expression of remorse as he struggled with the reality of Trump's new direction in Washington: \u201cSorry for this.\" (AP) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)", "summary": "Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

And that is certainly true as Pope Francis battles double pneumonia at Rome's Gemelli hospital. But the surprising success of \u201cConclave\u201d the film and momentum going into Sunday's Academy Awards have thrust the arcane rules, glorious ceremony and supreme drama of one of the Catholic Church's most solemn moments into popular culture, and put the Catholic hierarchy in something of a bind as it simultaneously prays for Francis.

The film can't be dismissed as distasteful or blasphemous, since it treats the gravity of a papal election with respect and accurately portrays the ancient rituals and contemporary problems facing today's Catholic Church. Both the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano and the Avvenire daily of the Italian bishops conference gave \u201cConclave\u201d rave reviews. Also Read | Ramadan 2025 Fasting Rules: Is Smoking Allowed While Fasting? Does Period Break Your Fast? List of Actions Than Can Invalidate Ramzan Fast. Granted, those reviews were published before Francis entered the hospital February 14 with a complex lung infection that has taken him out of commission for the longest time of his 12-year papacy. It's unclear if the newspapers would have published them after Francis' health took such a dire turn. That's even more the case since it's clear from the opening scenes in the Vatican's modern Santa Marta hotel where Francis lives that \u201cConclave's\u201d fictional dead pope is modelled after the real-life current one. But at the very least, the life-imitating-art coincidence of \u201cConclave\u201d the movie finding mass popular appeal at a time when the world's media has descended on Rome to monitor Francis' health has certainly piqued interest in what might happen in a real-life conclave. Author Harris knows it's a sensitive time \u201cConclave\u201d, director Edward Berger's adaptation of the Robert Harris novel starring Ralph Fiennes as the dean of the College of Cardinals, has been nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture. It goes into Sunday's Oscars with a Bafta win for best picture and a SAG award for best ensemble. Harris is well aware of the sensitivity of the moment, and how the surreal turn of events of an ailing pope dovetailing with an Oscar campaign had made his book and the film relevant to say the least. But he is adamant against trying to milk the moment for publicity. \u201cI've been refusing all requests to talk about it and a future conclave because I think that's in extreme bad taste,\u201d Harris told The Associated Press. \u201cI really hope he's got some more years yet.\u201d Francis suffered a setback on Friday, after he inhaled vomit during a coughing fit and required non-invasive mechanical ventilation to breathe. Doctors said they need 24 to 48 hours to evaluate how and if the isolated episode affected his overall clinical condition, while keeping his prognosis guarded. All of which has made \u201cConclave\u201d the film a bit too close for comfort in more ways than one for anyone following Francis' plight and concerned about what it means for the Catholic Church. Mild spoiler alert To recap: The film opens with the death of the pope and turns around the political maneuvering and manipulations behind the election of his successor. Cardinal Thomas Lawrence (Fiennes) is dean of the College of Cardinals, who must organise the conclave amid his own crisis of faith. With the future of the church weighing on him, he has to contend with secrets, scandals, smear campaigns and surprising twists, while ensuring the election's integrity. Massimo Faggioli, theologian at Villanova University, said the film was \u201csadly effective\u201d in illustrating the institutional instability that the Catholic Church is going through now, as well as the ease with which a single act or allegation of misconduct can ruin someone. \u201cThe main threats (are) now coming not from the outside (Napoleon, or Hitler, or secularisation), but from the inside (especially the fear of another sexual scandal),\u201d he said. For sure Berger takes some creative liberties. Cardinal Lawrence, for example, would have been excommunicated two or possibly three times for his efforts to navigate the intrigue, given the ban on communications with the outside world during a conclave and canon laws governing the seal of the confessional and the sealing of the papal apartments after a pope has died. But this is Hollywood, and His Eminence can be forgiven. Catholic media loved the film Avvenire, which hews to the Vatican establishment line, praised the film for its sumptuous beauty, twists of plot and \u201canything but trivial\u201d commentary about the current state of the church. \u201cLet's face it: Conclave,' which takes us to the heart of one of the world's most mysterious and secret events, is a highly entertaining film, especially for an American audience that isn't terribly picky,\u201d Avvenire said on December 20, when the film opened in Italian theaters and well before Francis got sick. Writing in the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano on February 1, critic Alessandra Comazzi highlighted the short but critical turn played by Isabella Rossellini, as Sister Agnes. As a longtime critic for the La Stampa daily, Comazzi is well aware of the Vatican taboo of openly talking of a conclave. But in an interview, she said the film managed to treat a conclave as thriller without causing offense. She said the Vatican newspaper was only too happy to publish her rave. \u201cThe dean Lawrence has to govern the conclave and liberate it from these false prophets,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think also from the ecclesial and religious point of view, the director managed to do it in a very respectful way.\u201d But a cardinal close to Francis didn't That said, someone who has actually participated in a conclave gave the film something of a thumbs down. \u201cMy experience of being in at least one conclave was not that it was some sort of scene of political backroom plotting of how to get your candidate elected,\u201d Cardinal Sean O'Malley, the retired archbishop of Boston, wrote in a Feb. 7 blog post. O'Malley voted in the 2013 conclave that elected Francis pope and is one of his closest allies. He said he and his brother cardinals were well aware that millions of Catholics were praying from afar \u201cso that the Holy Spirit would guide us in our deliberations.\" \u201cAnd, of course, at the moment when each cardinal votes, you take your ballot, stand in front of Michelangelo's image of Christ in the Last Judgment' and swear before God that you are going to vote for the person that you believe is God's will for the church,\" he wrote. \u201cIt's a much different experience than what they depicted in the movie,\" he wrote. \"For all its artistic and entertainment value, I don't think the movie is a good portrayal of the spiritual reality of what a conclave is.\u201d ___ Associated Press writer Hilary Fox in London contributed to this report. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

The recent successful completion of the bond exchange is a major milestone towards restoring debt sustainability,\" the IMF said in a statement. \"Reform efforts are bearing fruit with the recovery gaining momentum.

This triggered street protests due to acute shortages of essentials, food and fuel. Between March 2022 and March 2023, the Indian credit line of nearly USD 4 billion came to the island's rescue. The Indian assistance ended fuel queues and essentials shortages. As the country erupted in a crisis, calls were made for the ouster of then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake's predecessor Ranil Wickremesinghe, who implemented the IMF reforms, became unpopular and lost the September presidential election.

Everything you need to know before buying a USED electric car, from costs to brands", "text": "ARE you ready to join the electric vehicle (EV) revolution? \n\nBattery-powered cars are considered the future for passenger transport, and with EVs now making up nearly 20% of all cars sold in the UK, we\u2019re seeing a growing used market.\n\nFind a used electric car with Sun Motors\n\nFrom the boring and basic Prius to high-performance EVs like the Tesla Model 3, there\u2019s an EV for pretty much everyone. \n\nIn this guide, we focus on fully electric vehicles, not plug-in hybrids (PHEVs).\n\nSome drivers love the instant torque and stress-free driving experience of an EV, while others prefer the control and often lower cost of an internal combustion engine car.\n\nWe\u2019re going to provide some information and insights into electric vehicles, including running costs, charging costs and overall ownership expenses, which should help you in deciding whether to buy an electric vehicle. \n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to buy, you\u2019ll find the UK\u2019s largest selection of high-quality used electric vehicles for sale on Sun Motors.\n\nElectric car vs petrol car\u200b: What are the main differences?\n\nMost cars on the road are powered by a diesel or petrol-powered engine that provides drive, through a gearbox, to the wheels. \n\nDuring combustion, the engine produces emissions, which, after passing through the exhaust system and catalytic converter, are released into the environment.\n\nModel: Fiat\n\nElectric vehicles use a rechargeable battery that powers an electric motor. When you push the accelerator, the battery powers the motor, which changes this energy into torque, which powers the wheels through the driveshaft.\n\nPower delivery is almost instantaneous, and there are no gears to worry about. \n\nEVs are planet-friendly, with no tailpipe emissions (although there is an environmental impact, something we\u2019ll come to in a minute).\n\nCharging vs Refueling\n\nThe battery in an EV car runs out after a period of usage and needs to be charged. One of the most important stats for every EV is its range (how long it can be driven without needing to be recharged). \n\nLike the battery in your phone or laptop, EV car batteries become less efficient over time or in some situations, can break down. \n\nThe battery is the most expensive component in any EV, and replacing it can be expensive, costing over \u00a35,000, says EV charging specialists PodPoint.\n\nYou can refuel a petrol or diesel car in a few minutes, but it can take EVs much longer to recharge. Most EV owners will need a secure space to recharge their cars overnight, something to consider if you want to make the switch.\n\nDriving: Electric car vs petrol car\n\nWhen you first get behind the wheel, driving an EV can take some getting used to. They\u2019re more responsive, accelerate faster and produce much less noise than an internal combustion engine car. In the end, most drivers grow to enjoy driving an EV.\n\nThis is a basic description of the differences between internal combustion engine (ICE) cars and EVs. There is a huge range of EVs for sale today, and each comes with its own pluses, minuses and compromises that you should understand before making a purchase.\n\nHow much does it cost to charge an electric car?\n\nIt costs between \u00a34-\u00a320 to recharge an EV, says the RAC. That\u2019s an awful lot less than the average price to fill a diesel or petrol car, which currently tops \u00a370.\n\nWhy such a big difference in the cost? The total cost depends on several factors, including the size of the battery (bigger batteries take longer to charge and cost more) and your energy tariff. \n\nYou can\u2019t just plug your modern EV into the mains, you\u2019ll need a dedicated charging point, which can cost anything from \u00a3800-\u00a31200 to install.\n\nThere are some grants available to cut the cost of installing a home charger, which you can check out here.\n\nEV charging stations at the roadside (in some garages, service stations and supermarkets) can cost up to \u00a320, says PodPoint. \n\nHow long does it take to charge an electric car\u200b?\n\nIt can take anything from 30 minutes to 24 hours to completely charge an EV. \n\nYour electric car\u2019s charging time is affected by the battery size, charging speed and charging location, says energy firm Octopus.\n\nSlow chargers (7kw/h - 22 kw/h), the type you\u2019d have installed at home or find at supermarkets and car parks, can take up to 20 hours to top up a battery. \n\nIn contrast, fast/DC or rapid chargers (50kw/h-350kw/h) can provide up to 100 miles of power in less than 10 minutes.\n\nCompared to filling up at the pump, charging an EV isn\u2019t fast, which is why you\u2019ll need to plan if you\u2019re preparing for a long journey. \n\nTools like zapmap are vital resources that can help you locate your nearest EV charging point wherever you are in the UK.\n\nAre all electric cars automatic\u200b?\n\nYes, all electric vehicles are automatic.\n\nThe power provided to the motor is dictated by how hard you push the accelerator pedal. \n\nThe power from your electric car\u2019s motor is too fast to directly drive the wheels, so it\u2019s transferred through a reduction gear.\n\nWithout getting too technical, the reducer reduces the speed of the electric motor and increases the torque delivered to the wheels. \n\nThe result is better performance, acceleration and efficiency. This all happens under the bonnet.\n\nAre electric cars cheaper to run?\u200b\n\nThis is a complex question.\n\nIf we simply compare the cost of filling up a petrol-powered car compared to an EV, there\u2019s a clear winner.\n\nMaintenance and servicing costs for EVs are lower, too, with much fewer moving parts to go wrong. \n\nBookmygarage estimates the average EV service to be \u00a3103, that\u2019s almost half of a typical service.\n\nVED (commonly known as road tax) on EVs is currently \u00a30, which can save you compared to a petrol or diesel-powered car. (How long this lasts, we can\u2019t be sure so don\u2019t bank on this saving over the long-term.)\n\nAre used electric cars cheaper than new ones?\n\nEVs are going to cost you more to buy new. Moneysavingexpert has crunched the numbers and found that a petrol-powered Mini Cooper will cost around \u00a322,000 at a dealer, with the electric model coming in at over \u00a311,000 more expensive (approximately \u00a333,000).\n\nModel: Mini Electric Hatch Cooper\n\nInsurance costs can be higher for EVs, too. \n\nRepairs can also be a challenging too. Vehicle experts Warranty Solutions Group found that EV repairs can be 50% more expensive than petrol\u2013 or diesel-powered cars.\n\nGarages will need access to a whole range of tools and technologies to work on EVs, so it\u2019s unlikely that your local garage will be able to do a same day fix. \n\nProblems with the battery are the costliest to fix, with replacements running to thousands. \n\nThe good news is that the growing number of EVs on the roads means more garages and specialists available, which should hopefully translate into lower repair costs in the future.\n\nAre electric cars cheaper to insure?\n\nEVs are more expensive to buy, so it stands to reason that insurance prices should be higher than for other cars, but that\u2019s not always the case.\n\nIn fact, your driving history and overall risk profile are more important when it comes to dictating your premium than the type of car you drive, says the RAC.\n\nElectric cars for sale\u200b: Used Electric cars for sale on Sun Motors\n\nCheck out some of these used EV bargains from the brilliant dealers at Sun Motors:\n\nModel: BMW I3\n\nKnown for its high performance, prestige salons and estates, BMW has been improving its EV offering since 2021. \n\nToday, you can buy all-electric salons and SUVs, but our favourite remains the original BMW i3. \n\nThis super-stylish and ultra-compact car is perfect for cities.

Addressing the media in Dubai, ten Doeschate confirmed that Rohit is handling his injury well. \u201cHe\u2019s doing fine. As you can see, he\u2019s been batting and even did some fielding earlier. It\u2019s an injury he has dealt with before, so he knows how to manage it effectively, and he\u2019s staying on top of it,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe conversation also touched upon the wicketkeeping options of KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant. While Pant has been on the sidelines, ten Doeschate admitted that selecting the final XI at this level is always a challenging task. \n\u201cIt\u2019s been very hard on Rishabh not playing, but that\u2019s the nature of sport at this level. KL\u2019s been good. He didn\u2019t get many chances, and when you\u2019re batting at six or seven, it\u2019s difficult to get proper opportunities,\u201d he explained. \nHowever, the former Netherlands international praised Rahul for delivering in crucial moments. \n\u201cObviously, the third ODI in India, he did really well, and that knock against Bangladesh proved crucial in the end,\u201d he remarked. \nWith India having two top-quality wicketkeepers, ten Doeschate stressed the importance of keeping Pant ready for any opportunity. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep Rishabh up and running. We never know when we might need him, but having two wicketkeepers of that calibre is certainly a great advantage,\u201d ten Doeschate concluded. \nIndia\u2019s first-choice wicketkeeper-batter, KL Rahul, acknowledged feeling the pressure of Rishabh Pant waiting in the wings for his opportunity. With a player of Pant\u2019s caliber on the bench, Rahul admitted that there is always a \u201ctemptation\u201d to include either him or the explosive left-hander in the playing XI. \nIndia head coach Gautam Gambhir and his regime\u2019s decision to prioritize KL Rahul over Rishabh Pant has sparked divided opinions among fans and former cricketers. While some have supported the management\u2019s choice to retain Rahul in the ODI setup, others have advocated for Pant, highlighting his game-changing ability in the limited-overs format. \nRahul has finally opened up about playing ahead of Rishabh Pant, acknowledging the pressure that comes with the competition. The experienced batter made it clear that he isn\u2019t trying to compete with Pant but is instead focused on performing to the best of his ability and staying true to his game. \n\u201cI won\u2019t lie\u2014there is pressure. He\u2019s obviously a very, very talented player, and we\u2019ve all seen what he can do. He can change the game quickly with his aggressive style. So yes, there\u2019s always the temptation for the team, the captain, and the coach to decide between playing him or me,\u201d Rahul admitted during a press conference on Friday. \nIn the ongoing ICC Champions Trophy, Rahul has embraced his role as a wicketkeeper-batter. In India\u2019s tournament opener against Bangladesh, he continued his impressive form with a composed 41* off 47 deliveries, striking a solitary four and two towering sixes. \n\n\nSource link", "summary": "[ad_1] Home Sports \u2018It\u2019s an injury\u2026\u2019: Indian coach gives a major update on\u00a0Rohit\u00a0Sharma Indian assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate provides a crucial update on Rohit Sharma&#8217;s injury ahead of India&#8217;s ICC Champions Trophy 2025 clash against New Zealand.

The Chennai Super Kings will play their first match against Mumbai Indians on March 23 in Chennai. Retained by CSK in the uncapped category for \u20b94 crore, the legendary wicketkeeper-batter has joined the Yellow Army\u2018s camp for the 18th edition of the most popular cricket league around the globe.\n\nMS Dhoni is on the verge of creating history in IPL 2025 as he eyes a monumental milestone for Chennai Super Kings. With 4,669 runs to his name, Dhoni is currently CSK\u2019s second-highest run-scorer and needs just 19 more runs to surpass the top spot, cementing his legacy as the franchise\u2019s leading run-getter. \nSuresh Raina currently holds the top spot in Chennai Super Kings\u2019 all-time run-scorers list with 4,687 runs. Once the highest run-scorer in IPL history, Raina maintained an impressive average of 32.32 for CSK, scoring one century and 33 half-centuries. As MS Dhoni inches closer to this milestone, he has the chance to surpass Raina and etch his name at the top of the elite list in IPL 2025. \nFaf du Plessis holds the third spot in Chennai Super Kings\u2019 all-time run-scorers list, having amassed 2,721 runs for the franchise in the IPL. After being a key player for CSK, he moved to Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL 2022 mega-auction. In the IPL 2025 mega-auction, he was acquired by Delhi Capitals, marking another chapter in his T20 career. \nDhoni has a golden opportunity to surpass Suresh Raina\u2019s record in CSK\u2019s very first match of IPL 2025. However, as he bats lower down the order, he faces limited deliveries. Under Ruturaj Gaikwad\u2019s leadership, Dhoni will continue to play a crucial role for CSK. Meanwhile, Virat Kohli remains the leading run-scorer in IPL history, with 8004 runs in 252 matches, making him the only player to cross the 8000-run mark. Shikhar Dhawan, who retired from Indian cricket in August 2024, sits second with 6769 runs in 222 matches. Rohit Sharma follows at third with 6628 runs and will continue playing under Hardik Pandya\u2019s leadership at Mumbai Indians. \n\n\nSource link", "summary": "[ad_1] Home Sports MS Dhoni on verge of creating history for CSK in IPL 2025, will become first\u00a0batter\u00a0with\u2026.

This update was announced by captain Steve Smith following the cancellation of Australia's final league match against Afghanistan due to rain.\n\n Big setback for Australia. \n\n New Delhi: Australia faced a significant setback before the ICC Champions Trophy semifinal with the news that Matthew Short will not participate in the match. Short experienced a hamstring injury during Australia\u2019s recent league match against Afghanistan. Although he attempted to open the innings for Australia in a brief chase, he appeared to be in discomfort and had difficulty running between the wickets. His movement was hindered, making it challenging for him to execute his shots. He managed to score 20 runs off 15 balls during his brief time at the crease.\n\nAustralia has the option to replace the explosive opener with either Jake Fraser McGurk or all-rounder Aaron Hardie. Short performed well against England, contributing a rapid 63 runs, which helped Australia secure an exciting victory while pursuing a target of 352. \n\u201cI think he\u2019ll be struggling. I think we saw tonight he wasn\u2019t moving very well. I think it\u2019s probably going to be too quick between games for him to recover,\u201d Australia captain Steve Smith told Prime Video. \nAustralia advanced to the semifinals after their final league match was canceled due to rain. They had bowled out Afghanistan for 273 runs and reached 109-1 in just 12.5 overs, with Travis Head scoring 59 runs off 40 balls before the rain interrupted the game. Their earlier match against South Africa also ended in a washout. With two matches called off and one victory, Australia secured their spot in the semifinals with a total of four points. \nAustralia\u2019s opponent in the semifinal \nAustralia\u2019s semifinal rival will be determined following the India versus New Zealand game on March 2. Should South Africa win against England, they will secure the top position in the group, leading Australia to compete against the winner of the India vs New Zealand match. Conversely, if South Africa loses, Australia will claim the top spot in Group B and will go up against the loser of the India vs New Zealand game. \n\n\nSource link", "summary": "[ad_1] Home Sports BIG blow for Australia before potential ICC Champions Trophy semi-final against India as star batter RULED out Prior to the possible ICC Champions Trophy semifinal against India, Australia faced a significant setback as a key player was sidelined due to injury.

They were socializing with friends at the riverside in Guanacaste Park when their friends noticed that the pair hadn\u2019t resurfaced from the water for over twenty minutes. This prompted them to alert the authorities. News Five\u2019s Britney Gordon has the full report.\n\nBritney Gordon, Reporting \n\nToday, the University of Belize\u2019s flag flies at half-mast as students and faculty mourn the loss of Henry Osorio and Alexander Munoz. These promising biology majors were on track to graduate with their bachelor\u2019s degrees, but their lives were tragically cut short in a drowning incident at Guanacaste Park. Staff reported that Osorio, Munoz, and two female friends arrived around two p.m., but sadly, they were found dead less than three hours later. Commissioner of Police Chester Williams has more on this unfortunate incident.\n\nChester Williams, Commissioner of Police\n\n\u201cUpon arrival there, met two females in a frantic state. Those females told the police that the two male counterparts had gone under the water and had not resurfaced. Based on not the police conducting some searches in the area and the two male individuals were found and taken from the water, but by then it was too late. They were already without life. Based on that they were taken to the hospital and they were pronounced dead on arrival. The information we gathered so far is that the four of them were socialized, two male and two female, and one of the male person went into the water to take a swim and he began to drift away. And then the other one went to rescue him and he also drifted away. And then they would both submerge and did not resurface.\u201d \n\nThe Guanacaste Park swimming area is a favorite spot for both tourists and locals, with an entry fee of just a dollar. Police reported that the group had been drinking alcohol, which is allowed in the area. Zoe Sutherland, a friend and classmate of Alex Munoz, fondly remembers the happy times they shared at the riverside.\n\nZoe Sutherland, Friend of Deceased\n\n\u201cWe skipped chem and he\u2019s like, let me show you the river. And this was like five because we had a very late chem class. So we left and we stopped by the store. We got some snacks. And he showed me a river like by over there and we just sat and we just talked and we laughed and then he\u2019s like, okay, let\u2019s study chem. And I was like, what? And he\u2019s like, yeah, you thought I took you out of chem? No. So he went over the whole topic and everything. And he\u2019s like, I brought you here so I can teach you. And that\u2019s one thing I will always miss is his enthusiasm and his okayness to do anything, especially for me. He always helped with anything. If I needed him there, he would be there. And he was the main reason that I passed chemistry in my second semester.\u201d \n\nDr. Martin Cuellar, Dean of Student Affairs at the University of Belize, shared that the entire school is heartbroken by the news. To help students cope with their grief, the university organized a grief circle where they shared fond memories of Osario and Munoz and spoke with mental health professionals.\n\nDr. Martin Cuellar, Dean of Student Affairs, UB\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a tragedy when any family loses a member, especially a young, promising individual. And here we are at UB dealing with the terrible news that we have two of our students who have passed over the past twenty-four hours. As you can imagine, classmates are in tears, faculty members are breaking down. The university is in the full stages of grief. And then it is our job, obviously, as colleagues, as brothers and sisters of each other, to take care of each other as best we can. And so, we\u2019re doing everything possible to try to take care of each other. We have a grief circle that is just wrapping up right now for close friends, classmates in particular, of Henry and Alex, and then we have a memorial scheduled or being organized for next week.\u201d \n\nLongtime friends of Henry Osorio attended the vigil, sharing that his death hits especially hard because they grew up with him. Yasmine Franco fondly remembers that there wasn\u2019t a day when Henry wasn\u2019t smiling or making someone else laugh.\n\n\u200aYasmine Franco, Friend of Deceased\n\n\u201cOne time we were playing an online game, right? And she had a really bad internet connection, right? And we were all on a voice call together. And the game in summary If someone dies on your team, everyone restarts. And so she kept dying, and we were all in voice chat, and we were just screaming at her. I was laughing so hard. We all were laughing so hard. He just kept out spitting jokes, and I was like, I was in tears from laughing. And now we\u2019re in tears from mourning. So that, that hits different, because on that game, we can create profiles, and now I saw his profile online last night, and I\u2019m like, how was he online last night? And so I thought, that felt eerie to have lost a friend that was, it\u2019s eerie.\u201d \n\nSeveral classmates shared that both Osorio and Munoz were exceptionally bright and often competed for the top grades in their classes. In 2021, Alex Munoz, originally from Guinea Grass in Orange Walk, served as the Speaker of the House at the Children\u2019s Parliament. Hector Maldonado, who was supposed to meet with them for a project that very night, admired their academic drive and dedication.\n\nHector Maldonado, Classmate\n\n\u201cI really loved their interactions in class. They were like very interactive with the lecturers. They knew what they were talking about. They were book smart, we could say. And I just felt that I had the pressure of getting to their level where they are because they really knew a lot. So yeah, they were very interactive and involved in class.\u201d \n\nThe school is also extending individual counseling to those grieving and will continue to host intimate events in memory of Henry and Alex.

The Trump administration and DOGE have already slashed over 100,000 federal civilian jobs through layoffs and buyouts as part of their efforts to streamline government operations.

This event introduces participants to the ancient art of paper marbling, where they'll learn to float paint on a liquid base and create beautiful, one-of-a-kind patterns. It needs meticulous preparation, right from getting the materials to arranging the workspace. Choosing the right location is crucial for a successful workshop. It needs to be large enough to accommodate all participants comfortably and provide space for the marbling setup. Opt for locations with easily cleanable surfaces and ensure adequate ventilation, as the process uses water and paints. Community centers, art studios, or even outdoors (weather permitting) are excellent options. A well-stocked workshop is key to successful marbling. Trays for the paper sizes you want to marble, carrageenan (a seaweed thickener), acrylic paints in various colors, combs, styluses for patterns, alum (a mordant), and paper are all necessary. Buying in bulk can save you a lot of money. Search for suppliers who provide discounts for large purchases. Before diving into the practical portion of the workshop, provide a brief lecture on the art of paper marbling, its techniques, and history. Explain fundamental concepts like treating the paper with alum, thinning the paint to the correct consistency with water, and creating patterns with tools or even one's fingers. Reinforce learning with visual aids or live demonstrations. Although paper marbling is safer than many other art forms, you should still take precautions, particularly when using chemicals like alum or when children are involved. Always make sure to use non-toxic paints when possible and ensure that your venue has good ventilation. Providing gloves and aprons can also be a good idea to avoid any stains on clothes. One of the most rewarding aspects of hosting a DIY workshop is witnessing participants tap into their creativity by mastering new skills. Foster this by establishing inspiration stations throughout your venue, showcasing samples of various marbling techniques and patterns they can attempt to replicate during practice sessions following your initial demonstration.", "summary": "Hosting a DIY paper marbling workshop is a fun way to bring together both art lovers and those who are new to the craft.", "url": "https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/lifestyle/hosting-a-delightful-diy-paper-marbling-workshop-event/story", "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l83620250301100343.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 05:37:51", "author": "Anujj Trehaan", "authors": ["Anujj Trehaan"], "language": "en", "source_country": "sg", "sentiment": 0.662}, {"id": 295528022, "title": "This is what daily cold showers do to your body", "text": "Daily cold showers can transform your life by boosting your vitality and resilience. This underrated practice offers a plethora of health benefits, including optimized circulation, enhanced mental clarity, and a fortified immune system. While initiating this habit might be challenging, a gradual approach and consistency can make it an integral and invigorating part of your routine. Ease into the world of cold showers by slowly turning down the water temperature at the end of your regular shower. Start with thirty seconds of cooler water, then work your way up to one or two minutes over a few weeks. This gradual approach helps your body acclimate to the shock of cold water, making it less daunting and more manageable as you build up your tolerance. To conquer the discomfort of cold showers, focus on mastering your breath. Deep, controlled breathing not only soothes the mind but also reduces the body's initial shock response. Practice deep breathing before entering the shower and maintain it as you gradually decrease the temperature. This technique not only increases tolerance but also builds mental resilience over time. It's important to set realistic goals when introducing cold showers into your routine. Start by targeting three days a week, then work your way up to daily exposure as you acclimate to the experience. Be consistent; even brief periods under the cold water can yield positive results if done regularly. Cold showers aren't just a test of your physical endurance; they're a battle of willpower and mindset. Lean into that. Make it your ally. Turn what feels like torture into your secret weapon of strength and badassery. Accept the discomfort, but remember the rewards: a jolt of energy, a mood boost, and a newfound resilience against life's stresses. Documenting your progress serves as a powerful motivator to maintain this habit long-term. Take note of how long you're able to withstand the cold each day or week, and any changes you observe in your physical or mental state post-shower.

These communal pools are filled with mineral-rich waters believed to have healing properties for the skin and body, making them popular destinations worldwide. However, there are certain rules of etiquette you should follow when visiting these places to ensure everyone has a positive experience. This article provides key tips for first-time visitors to public mineral baths. In the communal setting of a public mineral bath, respecting others' privacy and personal space is paramount. It's important to keep a comfortable distance from other bathers and refrain from staring or making others feel uncomfortable. Conversations should be conducted at a low volume as the primary aim for many is relaxation. Before you jump into those mineral-rich waters, there's one thing you absolutely must do: shower. And we're not talking a quick rinse - you need a thorough, head-to-toe scrub. This is crucial to keep the water clean and enjoyable for everyone. Most places have showers right next to the pool for this reason. Even if you're using other facilities like saunas or steam rooms, you should still shower before entering. Every public mineral bath has its own rules about what to wear, how long to stay in the water, and which pools you can use. Some baths may require you to wear a swim cap or not let you jump into the pools. Following these rules keeps everyone safe and comfortable, including you and your fellow bathers. Chatting with friends or family members during your visit is natural. However, it's essential to maintain a whisper-level volume. This effort is crucial in preserving the peaceful ambiance that most mineral baths strive for. Loud conversations or laughter can quickly shatter the tranquility that many visitors come to enjoy. Respecting this atmosphere of quietude ensures a truly relaxing experience for everyone. Part of good etiquette when visiting public mineral baths is to make sure you don't leave any of your personal belongings or trash behind. Use the provided areas to throw away any waste and make sure to return any items you borrowed like towels or robes back to their proper places.

This gluten-free grain is a powerhouse of protein and other essential nutrients, making it a perfect complement to a vegetarian diet. Its distinctive qualities and health benefits are catching the attention of nutrition enthusiasts, providing a novel alternative for individuals looking for gluten-free options. Canary seeds pack a powerful protein punch - they're 20% protein, which is pretty high for a plant food. They also have healthy fats, fiber, and lots of minerals like calcium and magnesium. If you're vegetarian or vegan and looking for ways to get all your nutrients without eating animal products, you should definitely consider adding canary seeds to your meals. Perhaps the most notable benefit of canary seeds is that they are naturally gluten-free. This means that they are a great food option for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. In contrast to other grains that might have traces of gluten or carry the risk of cross-contamination, canary seeds are inherently devoid of gluten. This makes them a secure substitute. Canary seeds can be used in a variety of ways in cooking and baking. They can be ground into flour and used in breads, pancakes, and other baked goods as a gluten-free flour substitute. Plus, soaked canary seeds can be blended into smoothies or sprinkled on top of salads and yogurts for added crunch and nutrition. Please remember not all canary seeds are fit for human consumption. Always check for labels that specify the seeds have been processed and intended for human consumption. This way, you avoid any possible contaminants that may be found in bird-grade products. Human-grade canary seed products are subjected to thorough cleaning and packaging procedures, guaranteeing they are safe and hold their nutritional value for human diets. It's important to start with small quantities when incorporating canary seeds into your diet because of their high fiber content.

This stew is famous for its deep, complex flavors, achieved through a symphony of spices and vegetables. Knowing the essential spices for this dish is key for any home cook aiming to bring a piece of Poland into their kitchen. The unsung hero of bigos is the bay leaf, which provides the stew's aromatic backbone. Their delicate yet complex aroma and flavor permeate the stew during the slow cooking process. For a traditional pot of bigos, two to three leaves are sufficient, allowing their unique fragrance to add depth to the dish without overpowering it. Allspice is the secret weapon that gives bigos its warmth and depth. Its complex aroma, reminiscent of a combination of cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg, is why allspice berries (typically four to six) are added whole or ground into the stew. This unassuming spice works in harmony with the bay leaves, amplifying the flavors and bringing a comforting warmth to the dish. A good pinch of freshly ground black pepper brings a necessary spicy edge to bigos, helping cut through its hearty richness. If you're sensitive to heat, you might want to dial it back a notch. But even half a teaspoon will give your stew a nice lift without setting your mouth on fire. Juniper berries add a unique touch. The secret ingredient in Polish bigos is a handful of juniper berries. Their slightly crushed berries (you only need about five for a large pot) impart a pleasantly bitter, pine-like flavor that cuts through the richness of the stew, adding depth and a hint of the unexpected. Marjoram is the secret finishing touch in many Polish recipes, and bigos is no exception. Its sweet pine and citrus notes cut through the richness of the stew, adding a burst of brightness right before serving. A teaspoon of dried marjoram added during the last few minutes of cooking is enough to infuse the stew with this fresh flavor.", "summary": "Polish bigos, also known as hunter's stew, is a traditional dish that holds a special place in the hearts (and stomachs) of Poles.", "url": "https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/lifestyle/essential-spices-for-authentic-polish-bigos/story", "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l45420250301103522.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 05:37:51", "author": "Anujj Trehaan", "authors": ["Anujj Trehaan"], "language": "en", "source_country": "sg", "sentiment": 1.0}, {"id": 295528014, "title": "Introduce Tai Chi to kids: Benefits and easy steps", "text": "Tai Chi, the ancient martial art celebrated for its health benefits and meditative qualities, isn't just for grown-ups anymore. Teaching kids Tai Chi can be a fantastic way to nurture calmness, focus, and physical well-being in their lives. This article delves into easy ways to make Tai Chi fun and beneficial for kids, helping it become a positive part of their daily routine. Start by teaching children the fundamental concepts of Tai Chi: mindfulness, slow movements, and deep breathing. Initiate with basic exercises such as lifting their arms while taking a deep breath in and lowering them while breathing out. These exercises establish a foundation for more advanced movements and help children understand the concept of being in the present moment. To maintain children's engagement in Tai Chi, infuse your practice with games and storytelling. Leverage the power of imaginative play that mirrors Tai Chi's movements. For instance, become trees blowing in the wind or animals journeying through a forest. This not only injects fun into learning but also fosters physical and emotional connection to the exercises. The secret to mastering any new skill, including tai chi, lies in consistent practice. Foster a regular practice schedule that integrates seamlessly into the child's daily routine. Even ten minutes a day can profoundly impact their progress and the benefits they derive from tai chi. Dedicating time each day for practice instills discipline and cultivates respect for the art in children. Along with the physical movements, highlight the role of mindfulness in Tai Chi practice. Teach children to focus on their thoughts and feelings without judgment as they move through different poses. You can do this by asking them how they feel before, during, and after each session or by including moments of silence for mindfulness throughout the practice. Lastly, make sure the environment where your kids practice Tai Chi is a place that promotes relaxation and concentration. A quiet space free from distractions will help them focus and get the most out of their practice. You can also consider practicing as a family or creating a small group with other kids who want to learn Tai Chi. This way, they can build a supportive community of practitioners.", "summary": "Tai Chi, the ancient martial art celebrated for its health benefits and meditative qualities, isn't just for grown-ups anymore.", "url": "https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/lifestyle/cultivating-inner-peace-with-tai-chi-for-kids/story", "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l93020250301103007.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 05:37:51", "author": "Anujj Trehaan", "authors": ["Anujj Trehaan"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "sg", "sentiment": 0.694}, {"id": 295525692, "title": "I shot over 200 photos with the iPhone 16e vs Pixel 8a \u2014 here\u2019s the winner", "text": "Apple has a lot to prove by only giving the iPhone 16e just a single rear camera, especially when most phones in its price range offer dual-camera setups. The Pixel 8a is one of them and I\u2019ve said how it\u2019s the phone I\u2019d buy with my own money \u2014 a verdict I still stand behind.\n\nThat\u2019s why I captured over 200 photos with the iPhone 16e and Pixel 8a to better understand if the latest \u2018budget\u2019 iPhone can keep pace. I know very well what the Pixel 8a is capable of delivering, especially when it easily came out on top last year in my 200 photo shootout between the Pixel 8a and iPhone SE 2022. That face-off wasn\u2019t even close, which also cements the Pixel 8a\u2019s position in our best camera phones guide.\n\nThings are different this time around, as the iPhone 16e boasts a much improved 48MP main camera. But since Apple's phone only has a single rear camera, it's inherently at a disadvantage over the Pixel 8a\u2019s dual-camera setup \u2014 which pairs together a 64MP main camera and 13MP ultrawide. The latter lens is important because it allows me to capture more of the scene, which I\u2019m unable to do with the iPhone 16e unless I step back farther with it.\n\nSimilar to all of my past 200 photo shootouts, I take the same set of photos of both phones in various settings, which I then look over on a monitor later on to inspect their difference. For this test, however, I\u2019m only factoring in the performance of their main and selfie cameras.\n\niPhone 16e vs Pixel 8a: Daytime\n\nIn the majority of photos I\u2019ve captured during the daytime, the iPhone 16e\u2019s 48MP main camera comes out on top. Take a peek at the first set of images above overlooking the sandy beach with a ramp in the background.\n\nNot only does the iPhone 16e cast a brighter picture, but zooming in reveals a bit of sharpening that adds clarity to all the details in the shot \u2014 like the wooden railing to the left and the sand on the beach. The Pixel 8a still offers a good shot, but there\u2019s just a softness to it that doesn\u2019t make it stand out.\n\nWinner: iPhone 16e\n\niPhone 16e vs Pixel 8a: Colors\n\nColors are handled differently by the two camera phones, with the iPhone 16e clearly adding a bit more saturation. I really love the richer, more saturated colors of the produce on the shelf in the first batch of photos above. However, there\u2019s some color bleed with the red peppers.\n\nWhile the Pixel 8a\u2019s colors are still on the saturated side, it's nowhere as much as the iPhone 16e. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the vibrant colors of the iPhone 16e get my attention right away, but they\u2019re not true-to-life. For this reason, I\u2019m choosing the Pixel 8a\n\nWinner: Pixel 8a\n\niPhone 16e vs Pixel 8a: Dynamic range\n\nAgainst the harsh sunlight peeking through the tree in the first shots, the iPhone 16e\u2019s dynamic range performance does a much better job at boosting the shadows. As a result, I can see more of the details with the tree and branches. The Pixel 8a does a pretty good job, but the shadows are a smidge underexposed.\n\nThe results appear identical in all the rest of the photos, including the ones of the gazebo and the townhomes in the background \u2014 where the shadowed areas are much brighter on the iPhone.\n\nWinner: iPhone 16e\n\niPhone 16e vs Pixel 8a: Close-ups\n\nNeither phone offers a dedicated macro mode, but it doesn\u2019t stop them from taking some excellent looking close-ups. The flower in the first set of photos above looks amazing when I look at the overall photo. First of all, the colors are definitely more pronounced with the iPhone 6e, while the Pixel 8a has a toned down look that makes it look more accurate.\n\nZooming into the middle of the flower, it\u2019s the iPhone 16e that has the slightly sharper look, even though both capture nearly the same amount of detail. When I look at the petals, too, I can make out more definition with the iPhone 16e.\n\nWinner: iPhone 16e\n\niPhone 16e vs Pixel 8a: Selfie\n\nThe iPhone 16e packs a 12MP selfie camera, while the Pixel 8a comes with a 13MP one. I think they deliver adequate results, along with a very similar field of view for wider captures.\n\nYet, they process the selfies I shot differently. I will say that they manage to draw out a lot of detail, like some of my facial features and in the fabric of my hoodie. However, the Pixel 8a overcompensates for the shadows in the images by boosting them \u2014 which also inadvertently brightens up my skin tone. It\u2019s a good shot, but I like the more realistic looking ones from the iPhone 16e.\n\nWinner: iPhone 16e\n\niPhone 16e vs Pixel 8a: Portrait\n\nAll the portrait shots I captured with the iPhone 16e have too much of a warmer tone, which results in them looking yellowish. I also noticed that it missed blurring a part of the background with one of the shots I took above.\n\nOn the other hand, I prefer the creamier looking backgrounds that the Pixel 8a casts with its portrait shots, but I also like how the colors look more neutral.\n\nWinner: Pixel 8a\n\niPhone 16e vs Pixel 8a: Panorama\n\nI\u2019m happy to report that panoramas have an even exposure across the entire image. There\u2019s no weird stitching going on with either of them, plus I\u2019m impressed by how crisp they turn out.\n\nStill, the thing that gets my attention is how the Pixel 8a casts a stronger contrast throughout the shot. The first set of panoramas show this well, as the rocky lot on the sides and the grassy foreground have better contrast than the iPhone 16e\u2019s shot.\n\nWinner: Pixel 8a\n\niPhone 16e vs Pixel 8a: Zoom\n\nAll zooming is done through the main cameras on both phones, so this category boils down to how well each phone processes those shots to expose as much detail as possible. I shot all of the photos above at 2x and 8x zoom, just so you can see side-by-side their differences.\n\nAt 2x zoom, the results are pretty close, but the iPhone 16e manages to squeeze out more fine detail. It\u2019s not by a huge stretch, but enough for me to notice. If you look at the first set of photos of the American Legion building, zooming into the statue by the entrance of the lot reveals more definition to the stone pedestal it\u2019s sitting on top of.\n\nThen at 2x zoom, the results still favor the iPhone 16e. The fourth set of photos with the close-up of the gazebo reveals a sliver more definition with the wooden shingles on its room. Again, it\u2019s not substantially more, but still enough to notice.\n\nWinner: iPhone 16e\n\niPhone 16e vs Pixel 8a: Night time\n\niPhone 16e vs Pixel 8a: Low light\n\nTaking it one step further, I snapped the photos above with very little lighting in the scene \u2014 in order to see how the phones process them to draw out the details that are hidden there. I have to give Apple credit for a much improved performance over the previous iPhone SE 2022 because the iPhone 16e beats the Pixel 8a this time.\n\nI like how both phones brighten up the tree in my backyard in the first set of images, but the iPhone 16e\u2019s stronger definition really exposes the difference between them. More of the tree and its adjacent branches reveal better definition.\n\nWinner: iPhone 16e\n\niPhone 16e vs Pixel 8a: Verdict\n\nWhat a difference a year makes! The iPhone 16e, despite costing more than the previous iPhone SE 2022, proves that its single 48MP rear camera can produce best-in-class results. It beats the Pixel 8a in this photo shootout by a decent margin, and I\u2019m really happy to see that the iPhone is graced with much improved low light and zooming performances \u2014 two key areas where the iPhone SE 2022 failed to compete against the Pixel 8a.\n\nWhile it concedes to its rival, the Pixel 8a is still a phenomenal camera phone. I can\u2019t stress enough about how it has extra utility due to its ultrawide camera and the overall results still give the iPhone 16e heated competition. However, this might be a short lived celebration for the iPhone 16e considering how the Pixel 9a might be revealed soon.\n\nMore from Tom's Guide\n\nI tested Motorola\u2019s new budget phone and I'm surprised by what you get for less than $200I review phones for a living \u2014 and this is the budget phone I recommend to friends and familyThe Moto G Power (2025) promises long battery life \u2014 I found out if it could deliver", "summary": "The Pixel 8a demolished the iPhone SE 2022 in my camera shootout last year, but it's a different story in the latest photo face-off between the iPhone 16e vs. Pixel 8a.", "url": "https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/i-shot-over-200-photos-with-the-iphone-16e-vs-pixel-8a-heres-the-winner", "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fyg4zcyg6csv5DqwMMw6eL.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 05:01:00", "author": "John Velasco", "authors": ["John Velasco"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.336}, {"id": 295570596, "title": "PM Modi on 3-day Gujarat tour from today after party win in civic poll", "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi will begin a three-day visit to Gujarat on Saturday, following the BJP's sweeping victory in the state's local body elections.

a side piece in a city that has become accustomed to rampant, mindless violence. \n\nJust this week, everyday residents have been terrorised while trying to get on with their daily lives.\n\nOn Thursday, shocking footage was released by Victoria Police showing the moment a woman was attacked by a thug while she vacuumed her car.\n\nWitnesses told police they heard a 'piercing scream' from one of the women allegedly struck by the man at a car wash in Frankston, in Melbourne's southeast.\n\nPolice alleged the man tried to steal several cars from the car wash and assaulted a number of women - at least one while wielding a metal pole.\n\nIn Hoppers Crossing in Melbourne's west, horrors of a similar kind were breaking out.\n\nThis time two innocent victims were chased by offenders armed with machetes during a terrifying carjacking attempt in broad daylight.\n\nA woman was confronted by an alleged bandit at a Frankston car wash during the week \n\nKnife crime has gone through the roof in Melbourne \n\nVictorian detectives seized a record haul of edged weapons from a Dandenong factory \n\nThe horrifying attack was witnessed by parents driving their kids to school. \n\nHitting a residential Facebook page, one witness claimed to have watched a young girl running in horror into a church while pursued by a man wielding a machete.\n\n'I tried my best to stop him, but my daughter was in the car with me who was very scared also,' he wrote.\n\nHis post came with a warning that would be recommended by frustrated police.\n\n'Everyone please lock your car doors when you are out driving, these pigs tried to get into every car around them after they crashed,' the man warned.\n\nThe gang of six, who were all seen carrying weapons, remain at large.\n\nJust days earlier, up the highway in Footscray, a 24-year-old was stabbed several times after a group came to blows in front of locals and diners.\n\nCCTV footage captured the chaotic brawl spilling out onto a Footscray street just before 9.30pm. \n\nThe victim stumbled onto the pavement before collapsing on a park bench. \n\nMelbourne was once known for things not related to violent crime, lockdowns and misery \n\nKatie Tangey was killed in a house fire set by people alleged to be involved in Melbourne's 'tobacco war' \n\nHe remains in a critical condition in hospital. \n\nWhile these attacks happened in what could be described as 'working class' areas, Melbourne's well-to-do areas aren't faring much better. \n\nOn Monday, police charged a second man over a string of violent home invasions and armed robberies across the southeastern suburbs. \n\nIn one incident, in leafy Kew, a 77-year-old woman was allegedly confronted and assaulted by the pair and struck with a machete. \n\nAnother involved an alleged aggravated burglary in Prahran where a victim was threatened with a machete and a Subaru Impreza was stolen.\n\nThen there was the woman slashed while vacuuming her car at a car wash in Cheltenham, 18km south-east of the CBD, on February 22 - again in broad daylight. \n\nOn Friday, an arson attack on a Melton barber shop, in Melbourne's outer west, hardly rated a mention in news broadcasts. \n\nFormer Victoria Police Commissioner Shane Patton was forced to step down after a vote of no confidence by members \n\nA woman was slashed with a machete at this Melbourne car wash \n\nNor did the three youths police arrested following a wild pursuit through Melbourne\u2019s southeast that night. \n\nMelburnians have become so accustomed to hearing about arson attacks they rarely take-up much more than a postage stamp of news space online and but a brief 'voice over' on nightly bulletins. \n\nWhen Melbourne burlesque dancer Katie Tangey was killed in a house fire in January, police went to lengths to tell the community they believed it had nothing to do with the city's ongoing 'tobacco wars'. \n\nThe 27-year old had been house sitting her brother's home in Truganina - a short drive from Thursday's Hoppers Crossing machete attack - when arsonist set the house on fire. \n\nShe and her brother's dog were both killed in the senseless attack. \n\nIt would take a month for detectives to go public with their belief Ms Tangey had indeed been an innocent victim in the ongoing tobacco war. \n\nBy then, Sam 'The Punisher' Abdulrahim had been executed in a daring daylight assassination by brazen killers that also remain at large. \n\nUnlike Ms Tangey's cruel demise, Abdulrahim's murder filled news pages for a week. \n\nThe blaze that killed Katie Tangey \n\nFOrmer footy WAG Bec Judd has been a vocal critic of Victoria's crime wave \n\nHe had been a major player in the war, which but for a moment led the news agenda across Australia. \n\nBy this week, the war had become but a joke again among Melbourne's battle weary crime reporters. \n\nThe Herald Sun went so far as to write a 'funny' piece declaring Kazem Hamad - the alleged kingpin behind many of the city's fires - was a 'man of action' that ought run for Premier. \n\n'It looks as if Hamad has achieved a lot more in the black market tobacco sphere than the State Government has in the past two years,' it rightly noted. \n\n'In that time, he and other players have gone on a Big Build of their own, setting up more than 1000 shops across Victoria, meanwhile coordinating massive overseas shipments to stock them ... Runs on the board!'\n\nVictoria Police confirmed that the number of arson attacks had reached 105 by October 2024 - the month cited as marking the one-year anniversary of the establishment of Taskforce Lunar, which investigates the attacks. \n\nSam 'The Punisher' Abdulrahim goes to the ground after being executed in Melbourne by hitmen \n\nSam 'The Punisher' Abdulrahim became another Melbourne crime statistic \n\nYouth crime is so proficient it too has been largely shunted to the back pages of news publications. \n\nBut it is a crime that could decide the fate of the Victorian premier Jacinta Allan.\n\nIn the year ending September 30, 2024, 23,810 crimes were committed by children aged 10\u201317 - a 16.9 per cent increase from the previous year.\n\nIn August last year, then Chief Commissioner Shane Patton told Victorians 'child crime' was the biggest concern for police. \n\nOn February 5 his government masters declared they had confidence Mr Patton could clean up the mess. \n\nHe was gone 11 days later. \n\nIn the days since his departure, the war on crime by his burnt-out former colleagues has continued. \n\nOn Thursday, Victoria Police revealed a record number of knives had been seized from Victorian streets last year, with almost 40 blades found and destroyed each day.\n\nVictoria Police take down protesters at Melbourne's Shrine of Remembrance during the state's Covid-19 lockdowns\n\nPremier of Victoria Jacinta Allan has been accused of putting her head in the sand on the state's crime problems\n\nThe announcement came after the recovery of 930 samurai swords, zombie knives and katana swords from inside a Dandenong South factory.\n\nBut while chaos has reigned on the streets of Melbourne, Victoria Police members have been at war with the government over a pay rise. \n\nThe ongoing dispute has done little to help the public's view of police by Melburnians - many of whom have never forgiven them for their heavy-handed treatment during Dan Andrews' world beating Covid lockdowns. \n\nOn Friday, voting ended on a voting on a five per cent annual raise over four years for frontline officers and a 4.5 per cent a year wage rise for other officers. \n\nThe Police Association and Victoria Police struck an in-principle deal in May on a nine-day fortnight and 16 per cent pay rise across four years.\n\nBut it was knocked back by staff in July, leading hundreds of police to walk off the job for the first time in 25 years.\n\nIn the background, angry Melburnians hit social media to vent about the state's crime wave. \n\nThey talk about it at the pub and with mates over a barbeque in what they hope is the safety of their own homes. \n\nFitzroy North local Robert Morton summed it up best. \n\n'Victoria may be the education state but you can't out smart a knife, or a bullet,' he said. \n\nShare or comment on this article:\nMelbourne loses its shine as Australia's most liveable city as crime wave strikes\n\nAdd comment", "summary": "Once regarded for its casual cool, thriving music scene and choice of eateries, Melbourne's news broadcasts are now filled with reports on carjackings, fire bombings and random knife attacks.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14445241/melbourne-crime.html", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/28/01/95675789-0-image-m-23_1740706581124.jpg", "video": "https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/02/17/2610134428862073399/1024x576_MP4_2610134428862073399.mp4", "publish_date": "2025-03-01 07:11:43", "author": "Editor,Wayne Flower", "authors": ["Editor", "Wayne Flower"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.174}, {"id": 295570570, "title": "Hollywood star TONI COLETTE on seeing a side of her co-star Robert Pattinson that the public never sees, why she shaved her head six times and how turning 50 was 'a total breeze'", "text": "The weather in London is freezing, and Toni Collette, who arrived a couple of days previously from sweltering Sydney, peers, aghast, through the windows of the hotel room where we\u2019re meeting, at the leaden sky. \u2018It\u2019s so cold!

When she was younger, she shied away from people telling her \u2013 correctly \u2013 she was gorgeous. Has she got better at accepting compliments? \u2018I have! I\u2019ve been very good at giving and taking care of other people,\u2019 she says, with her signature throaty chuckle. \u2018Now I\u2019m getting very good at receiving care.\u2019\n\nA genuine A-lister, Collette has starred in everything from Muriel\u2019s Wedding back in 1994 (\u2018That film will never go away. People love her, I love her\u2019), to The Sixth Sense, which won her an Oscar nomination, as well as About a Boy and Little Miss Sunshine, to Knives Out. In person she comes across as slightly hippyish. She\u2019s constantly doing cat-like yoga stretches and appears totally unaffected, swearing constantly. After we meet, when she appears on The One Show, host Vernon Kay apologises to the audience for her \u2018potty mouth\u2019 \u2013 she said \u2018s**t\u2019 \u2013 only for her to swear again, mortified.\n\nToday, she lives in an upmarket beachside suburb, but she\u2019s very much in touch with her working-class, no-nonsense roots in down-at-heel Blacktown, Western Sydney. One of her two brothers, who both have white-collar jobs, still lives there and she visits often. (\u2018It hasn\u2019t gentrified much.\u2019) Her dad Bob was a lorry driver, her mum Judy worked in customer services. \u2018They\u2019re good, grounded people.\n\nWe \u201cWesties\u201d are considered very uncouth, very daggy,\u2019 Collette says. \u2018Do you know what that means?\u2019\n\nI do \u2013 it means shabby and a tad uncool.\n\n\u2018Exactly! Not that that should have anything to do with anything, but in terms of what we are as a family and where I grew up I am like some kind of alien. The trajectory of my life is so magical and bizarre and I\u2019m so f***ing grateful. Not Grammy-speech grateful \u2013 honestly grateful because it\u2019s not what my life was.\u2019\n\nWe\u2019re here to discuss Collette\u2019s latest role (\u2018I can\u2019t remember every film I\u2019ve done any more, which is weird because when you\u2019re younger you think you\u2019ll never forget anything\u2019) in Mickey 17, directed by Bong Joon Ho, whose black-comedy thriller Parasite swept the 2020 Oscars, with awards including, for him, best director. The new sci-fi film is, as Collette puts it, \u2018tonally all over the place, but in the best way. I really wanted to work with Bong. The first time we zoomed I had sweaty pits because I was so nervous.\u2019\n\nPart dystopian horror, part comedy, Mickey 17 is the tale of a mission, led by megalomaniacal failed presidential candidate Kenneth Marshall (Mark Ruffalo) and his scheming wife Ylfa (Collette), to colonise an icy distant planet. Mickey, played by Twilight\u2019s Robert Pattinson, is an \u2018expendable\u2019 \u2013 a worker assigned life-threatening chores because every time he dies he\u2019s replaced by a \u2018printout\u2019 replica of his body, with his emotions and memories uploaded on a hard disc.\n\nWhile Mickey is tackling monsters in sub-zero temperatures, Kenneth and his wife luxuriate in their space-station quarters. Ylfa is \u2018a 1950s housewife crossed with a smiling assassin\u2019. As Collette describes her, she is clearly the brains behind the operation. \u2018There\u2019s a hyper-femininity to her and she uses that gentle, snake-like presence to manipulate her husband and pull the strings. He just needs a little help. They completely love each other \u2013 Bong said, \u201cI want it to feel they\u2019ve either just had sex or are about to jump into bed together.\u201d\u2019\n\nAs a fake-tanned billionaire, Kenneth bears a striking resemblance to Donald Trump (his supporters wear red, Maga-style baseball caps). \u2018He\u2019s an amalgamation of different characters. I\u2019d rather not give that real-life buffoon any more airtime,\u2019 Collette says with a roll of her eyes.\n\nThe satire is often dark, but filming in Hertfordshire \u2013 you\u2019d never guess from the extraordinary sets \u2013 was nonstop giggles. \u2018Mark Ruffalo had me crying with laughter daily.\u2019 And what about Pattinson, dismissed by some as a \u2018hunk\u2019, but here pulling off an acting masterclass? \u2018The guy\u2019s a genius. You can see him as this sweet, daggy young guy he was once and think how weird it must have been for him stepping into heartthrob land. It must be so frustrating for actors whom others attempt to pigeonhole, when he\u2019s so capable.\u2019\n\nBeing pigeonholed is a fate Collette has avoided brilliantly. In person, she\u2019s low-key glam, with long, glossy blonde hair and immaculate make-up, wearing an obviously designer white blazer and black trousers (\u2018These are borrowed, I\u2019m going to have to give them back\u2019). Yet, on screen, she\u2019s always dodged playing personality-free arm candy for more complex characters.\n\nCollette agrees: \u2018Those arm-candy parts are where characters go to die. But things are changing a lot. In my industry they talk about older women becoming obsolete and casting younger ones, but my career just gets better. I don\u2019t know how I ended up in this position, but it just keeps on happening.\u2019\n\nI\u2019d say it\u2019s because Collette held out for the (small number) of decent parts available, where the way her character looked had no bearing on the plot. \u2018I\u2019ve always thought what happens internally is more important than external stuff,\u2019 she shrugs.\n\nCollette is in London to start filming a top-secret project. How does that work when her children \u2013 Sage, 17, and Arlo, 13 \u2013 are on the other side of the world? Presumably, though she won\u2019t say, they\u2019re with their dad, drummer David Galafassi, another Aussie, whom she divorced just over two years ago after 19 years of marriage (they\u2019d been separated \u2018for a substantial period\u2019 and he\u2019s since been snapped embracing another woman). She won\u2019t discuss the split but says, \u2018You grow the most from the most difficult challenges. If you do that you feel so strong. So, you need to see them as an opportunity rather than from some victim perspective.\u2019\n\n\u2018The children couldn\u2019t come with me \u2013 the school year\u2019s just begun in Australia,\u2019 she says of the family setup. \u2018It\u2019s fine \u2013 once I start shooting I\u2019ve got a little break in the middle so I can go back. We used to travel together and last year they came on two jobs with me for a bit. I\u2019ve just had a big chunk at home, so it balances out, but it\u2019s still pretty painful. I don\u2019t like being away from them at all \u2013 thank god for FaceTime!\u2019 Motherhood has made her even pickier about the jobs she chooses. \u2018I think, \u201cIs this worth leaving the house for?\u201d It has to speak to my soul, otherwise I\u2019d rather stay at home with them.\u2019\n\nShe rolls up her sleeve to show me a tattoo (she has eight in total) of their names, spelt in childlike calligraphy. \u2018It\u2019s a copy of my daughter\u2019s writing when she was five,\u2019 she says. Do they have the performance genes of their parents? Collette nods. \u2018My daughter\u2019s got an incredible singing voice, so we\u2019ll see. I\u2019ll support them in whatever they want to do.\u2019\n\nCollette could hardly say otherwise, as her parents allowed her to quit school (\u2018I was pretty good at school\u2019) at 16 to pursue acting. \u2018I\u2019m sure my parents were worried, but I was pretty strong-willed. I had such big balls at that age, I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t need a backup.\u201d It\u2019s so weird because I had no access to this world at all, I didn\u2019t know how to enter it. But I had this belief of somehow finding work.\u2019\n\nHer instincts were correct. Apart from a brief spell delivering pizzas, she\u2019s acted nonstop. Barely into her 20s, she won the life-changing role of dumpy, lovable Muriel, longing for a wedding, and the film became a global smash. Collette is honest about the effects of sudden fame \u2013 for a period she suffered from panic attacks. She also partied hard. \u2018My god, the things I did!\u2019 she beams. \u2018I\u2019ve shaved my head six times, the first time in Mexico, when I was 25. I just wanted to do it and the cleansing aspect of it felt f***ing great. It felt like a fresh start.\u2019\n\nThere have been misses. We\u2019re speaking just as the UK has gone crazy for Mad About the Boy, the fourth film in the Bridget Jones franchise, a role originally offered to Collette. She rejected it because she was in a Broadway show, so it went to Ren\u00e9e Zellweger. Then there was the time she failed to progress further than a meeting with fellow Aussie, director Baz Luhrmann, about what was to become another mega-hit, Moulin Rouge!. Is she ever tormented by such what ifs? \u2018Never! You get what you\u2019re meant to get, and everyone has their own path.\u2019\n\nShe\u2019s clearly not wild about air-kissy Hollywood and avoids awards ceremonies such as the Oscars. \u2018I\u2019ll go if I have to, otherwise I really won\u2019t.\u2019 Disappointingly, there\u2019s no WhatsApp group where Aussie superstars such as Collette, Nicole Kidman, Cate Blanchett and Hugh Jackman chinwag \u2013 \u2018I know them all to say \u201chi\u201d to, but we\u2019re living our lives.\u2019 She still hangs out with her old school friends \u2013 though her best buddy from those days now lives in London. \u2018Once I get over the jet lag, I\u2019ll have time to play,\u2019 she says, grinning.\n\nNo one stands on ceremony around her \u2013 which I can well imagine as, unlike most A-listers, she evidently has zero ego. \u2018\u201cDon\u2019t you know who I am?\u201d That\u2019s not me. Sometimes when people don\u2019t recognise me, they\u2019re like, \u201cOh god, I\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t realise.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cAre you for real? You don\u2019t have to apologise. I actually prefer it.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nHer humility and laidbackness are entwined with a fascination for spirituality. She loves numerology, and tries explaining the significance of her birthday, 1 November (01/11), but the jet lag overwhelms her and she peters off, giggling. She is also into astrology (\u2018I used to hate being Scorpio because we feel everything so deeply, but now I wouldn\u2019t live any other way\u2019) and meditates regularly.\n\n\u2018Every single time I meditate I have an experience of oneness with the universe. For a while it freaked me out and I had to stop, because there was a sense of surrender and it felt like dying. But now I love it because I believe that\u2019s what we are \u2013 all from the same source. We\u2019re all one love.\u2019\n\nWith such a mindset she had no anxieties about celebrating her 50th birthday, shortly before she announced the end of her marriage. The date fell during the filming of Mickey 17, thus necessitating two parties: one in London, another on her return to Sydney. \u2018It was a joyous time. I felt really trepidatious about 40: \u201cI\u2019m 40 \u2013 how can this be?\u201d Two friends died around that time and for a long while I really worried about death. But now I have total calm and acceptance about it. It\u2019s healthy to think about death; it brings context to life. So turning 50 was a total breeze. There was complete joy, a sense of freedom, a real appreciation of life, seeing things clearly and feeling like I was in a really good place.\u2019\n\nShe is thrilled \u2018conversations\u2019 are starting about midlife female sexuality \u2013 see the aforementioned Bridget Jones or Nicole Kidman\u2019s latest film, Babygirl. \u2018I\u2019d love to read [The X Files star] Gillian Anderson\u2019s book [Want, about women\u2019s sexual fantasies]. She\u2019s really vocal about all that and I admire her.\u2019\n\nMore generally, Collette loves getting older \u2018because you don\u2019t give a s**t. I\u2019d like people to enjoy my work, but there\u2019s no time to care about what others are thinking of you. You waste so much time doing that when you\u2019re younger. Just live your life.\u2019\n\nMickey 17 will be released in cinemas nationwide on 7 March\n\nToni\u2019s life through a lens \n\nMuriel\u2019s Wedding (1995) \n\nCollette stars as lovable misfit Muriel from Porpoise Spit, Australia, whose only dream is to marry. Worth it for her Abba renditions alone.\n\nThe Sixth Sense (1999) \n\nShe was nominated for an Oscar as Lynn Sear, the divorced mother of Cole (Haley Joel Osment), a young boy who sees dead people.\n\nAbout a Boy (2002)\n\nSad and hilarious as the \u2018daft f***ing hippie\u2019 mum of an oddball outcast (Nicholas Hoult), playing opposite Hugh Grant. Excellent British accent to boot.\n\nHereditary (2018)\n\nOne of the scariest demonic films ever. Collette is a grieving mother in meltdown. Her screams, as her husband (Gabriel Byrne) burns alive, still haunt viewers.\n\nKnives Out (2019)\n\nShe is howlingly funny as the new-age yet money-hungry widow Joan, who owns Goop-like company Flam, in Rian Johnson\u2019s whodunnit.", "summary": "She's out of this world in the new sci-fi film Mickey 17, but in person TONI COLLETTE is winningly down to earth.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-14430285/toni-colette-mickey-17-interview.html", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/24/14/95530767-0-image-m-43_1740407753886.jpg", "video": "https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/02/26/5733428352504017149/1024x576_MP4_5733428352504017149.mp4", "publish_date": "2025-03-01 08:01:39", "author": "Editor,Julia Llewellyn Smith", "authors": ["Editor", "Julia Llewellyn Smith"], "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.14}, {"id": 295570564, "title": "Horoscopes: What star sign should let go to make room for something better?", "text": "20 Feb-20 March Life isn\u2019t meant to be a constant struggle.

Four film critics reveal the reasons they're so divided over the Oscar-nominated Spanish musical Emilia Perez", "text": "Brash, gaudy, vulgar \u2013 it\u2019s great!\n\nBy Lynn Barber\n\nIf there were an Oscar awarded for good taste in film-making then obviously Emilia P\u00e9rez would not be a contender. It is never less than brash, gaudy, vulgar, shocking, outrageous. My favourite scene is a musical number set in a cosmetic surgery hospital where nurses run around shouting, \u2018Rhinoplasty! Vaginoplasty! Mammoplasty!\u2019 You wouldn\u2019t get that in The English Patient. But then you wouldn\u2019t laugh so much either.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing to find that Emilia P\u00e9rez is a musical, as the plot concerns a drugs-cartel boss receiving gender reassignment \u2013 in other words, a pretty heavy drama, except for the characters periodically breaking into song. Admittedly the songs are hardly Rodgers and Hammerstein, but they\u2019re emotionally effective \u2013 one where the drugs-cartel boss, having transitioned to a woman, sees her children again, had me blubbing on the sofa.\n\nThe acting is really great \u2013 Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n as Emilia and Selena Gomez as her former wife are outstanding, but I was also very taken with Zoe Salda\u00f1a, who plays Rita, the lawyer tasked with arranging Emilia\u2019s gender reassignment. She looks rather straight-faced and serious for much of the film, then suddenly breaks into a wild Dionysian dance at a fundraising dinner \u2013 one of the best dances I have ever seen on screen.\n\nHaving garnered 13 Oscar nominations, Emilia P\u00e9rez then faced a tremendous backlash. Mexicans disapproved of the portrayal of their country as a drug-riddled swamp and complained that Gasc\u00f3n, who is from Spain, doesn\u2019t always get the Mexican accent right. And, of course, she is trans (in fact the first trans actress to be Oscar-nominated), which you\u2019d think would please trans activists but apparently not.\n\nThen it transpired that Gasc\u00f3n had posted racist comments on social media in the past, which meant she was pretty much dropped from the pre-Oscar publicity. Look, there are a million reasons to disapprove of the film if you\u2019re the disapproving kind, but if you want an original, jaw-dropping experience, then Emilia P\u00e9rez is for you.\n\nWho should win? Emilia P\u00e9rez, of course!\n\nSo bad it had me reaching for a second bottle of wine\n\nBy Nick Curtis\n\nWherever possible, Mrs C and I like to watch movies on the big screen in a place with sumptuous seats and a decent bar, but I\u2019m glad we watched Emilia P\u00e9rez at home because otherwise our drinks bill would have been huge. \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 my wife Ann muttered after 15 minutes of indistinct shapes shifting around in the gloom. \u2018No idea,\u2019 I said, emptying the bottle. \u2018Do you think Zoe Salda\u00f1a is meant to be singing that badly?\u2019\n\nThat it is dimly lit is a small mercy. Emilia P\u00e9rez takes the most saccharine of showbiz genres \u2013 the musical romance \u2013 and feeds it through a mincer of arthouse stylings and hot-button issues: gender, race, drugs. It pushes performers like Salda\u00f1a and Selena Gomez \u2018bravely\u2019 out of their comfort zones. No wonder Hollywood types love it \u2013 they get to appear progressive, socially concerned, more than just purveyors and consumers of vacuous entertainment.\n\nThe scene that had me reaching for a second bottle of wine was when Emilia, having transitioned from murderous gangster to a sort of queen of hearts for victims of Mexico\u2019s drug wars, falls in love with a bereaved woman after they compare their concealed weapons.\n\nHaving toughed my way through the film I switched streamers with relief and watched Gary Oldman swearing, smoking and farting through an episode of Slow Horses. Now that\u2019s entertainment.\n\nWho should win? A Complete Unknown. Chalamet is startlingly good.\n\nI need trauma therapy after watching a man in a lab coat belting out \u2018vaginoplasty!\u2019\n\nBy Julie Bindel\n\nLet the record state that I had to watch Emilia P\u00e9rez. I was aware that it has achieved the lowest ranking from critics ever seen for an Oscar nomination, as well as an audience score of 17 per cent on the website Rotten Tomatoes (so far!); that it has angered Mexicans, transgender activists \u2013 probably even members of criminal cartels \u2013 for its laughably inaccurate portrayal of a Mexican gang leader who wants a sex change. But I was due to discuss it on a podcast so, armed with plenty of gin, I dived in.\n\nEven prepared, I was flabbergasted. It is one of the worst films I have ever seen. The vaginoplasty song, set in a cosmetic surgery clinic, is a particularly egregious stinker: \u2018I\u2019d like to know it all/what is the protocol?\u2019 sings \u2013 for want of a better word \u2013 Zoe Salda\u00f1a\u2019s character as she tunelessly asks a doctor about every sex-change operation under the sun, surrounded by nurses with clipboards and a chap in a wheelchair who seems as nonplussed as we are. \u2018Man to woman/from penis to vagina,\u2019 the doctor sings back. And those are some of the better lines.\n\nI began to fantasise about switching over to an old episode of Antiques Roadshow. Or Cats. Nor was I taken with Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s turn as the gang boss. Mrs Doubtfire was a much more Oscar-worthy character all round. The storyline is ridiculous, the acting OTT, the script bad enough without the characters sporadically singing from it. I am off for trauma therapy, in an attempt to rid my wounded brain of the image of a man in a lab coat belting out the word \u2018vaginoplasty!\u2019 in C flat.\n\nWho should win? A Complete Unknown. A total joy.\n\nI found the whole storyline gripping, and the acting superb\n\nBy Mary Killen\n\nI wasn\u2019t looking forward to Emilia P\u00e9rez as I\u2019ve always thought musicals too implausible to get absorbed in \u2013 people just yelling out banal sentences to orchestral accompaniment.\n\nThe exception is The Sound of Music, which I\u2019ve watched at least 30 times. Would I watch the polar opposite? Emilia P\u00e9rez is the seedy story of a Mexican drugs-cartel boss who has, via mass killings of rivals and the enslavement of untold numbers of addicts, made more money than he could ever spend while being cheated of his one desire: to be a woman. How could I empathise with such a criminal?\n\nSet on the noisy, chaotic streets of slums, what could possibly be the appeal? Two hours 12 minutes later I had not taken my eyes from the screen. So unlikely was my compulsion, I wondered if AI had implanted some hypnotising tool into the production. I found the storyline unpredictable and gripping, the acting superb.

The \u2018thinking person\u2019s wellness hotel\u2019, it features spas, sports and culture. With snow outside and opulence inside, I could definitely feel well here.\n\n12.45pm In my presidential suite (the hotel has hosted two G7 summits) I wonder: which world leader has slept in my bed? Trying not to imagine Boris in my superking (a sure wellness killer), I make for the hotel\u2019s Tutto Mondo restaurant for winter cod with pickled grapes. \n\n3pm After a quick picture-perfect hike, it\u2019s sauna time at Schloss Elmau\u2019s outdoor nature spa. Cue a hut by a stream, where a therapist, dressed in just a napkin, wafts a towel to disperse essential oils through 32C heat. The oils are a treat; a dip in the icy stream less so. \n\n7pm Some intel: the Schloss is not one but two buildings: there\u2019s the modern Retreat, where I\u2019m staying, and, a mere skip away, the 19th-century Hideaway. Here I order sushi on repeat at its Pan-Asian Fidelio restaurant, before drinks and live jazz in the Al Comino bar.\n\n9am Ready to herabschauender hund? (that\u2019s downward dog to you). Yep, I do hatha yoga in German, which I don\u2019t speak, so it\u2019s a little stressful. Next, my five-star breakfast buffet of eggs, fruit, granola, cold meats, cake and fizz ensures any wellness-ometer hit is temporary. \n\n11am Can I ski? No, I get overtaken by kids on nursery slopes. Still, I plan to nail a cross-country skiing lesson. How hard can it be? Well, quite hard. But I do stay upright and, by moving at 5mph, I get to lap up views of the Zugspitze, Germany\u2019s highest mountain.\n\n2pm Hello, signature relaxing massage \u2013 a mix of Swedish, sports and Thai techniques plus, I swear, wrestling holds. It\u2019s firm but blissful. Next, the outdoor saltwater pool \u2013 eyes on the scenery not the naked bathers. Finally, tea and turkish delight in the Oriental Hamam lounge.\n\n8pm My brain wants some wellness, so I pull up a chair in the Hideaway\u2019s 300-seat concert hall. Culture is in Schloss Elmau\u2019s DNA; everyone from writer Ian McEwan to musician Jacob Collier has appeared here. Tonight I\u2019m wowed by Beethoven, courtesy of pianist Alice Sara Ott.\n\n8am Hometime, but not before a dip in the piping-hot Japanese onsen pool and a selfie on a bench made famous by Angela Merkel and Barack Obama in 2015.

I was absolutely allergic to all the bright saccharine pinks that made women look like overgrown fairy princesses. The whole movement was horrid.\n\nThis season pink is back but it\u2019s very different. Think quieter, more mature and sophisticated. Powder pink, rose pink and light pinks have taken spring by storm \u2013 Cos\u2019s dusty-pink version of my favourite tailored black trousers immediately sold out. The ones I\u2019m pictured wearing, also by Cos and in a slightly brighter shade, are selling fast. Jigsaw, Arket and Reiss have similar pink tailored styles and they\u2019re all proving popular.\n\nThis time round I\u2019m enthusiastic about the pink invasion and plan to style it with a crisp white shirt along with various caramel and mocha pieces. \u2018Powder pink is often associated with softness, optimism, nostalgia and playfulness,\u2019 says Carolyn Mair, author of The Psychology of Fashion. \u2018The trend reflects a psychological desire to reconnect with simplicity, childhood and unfiltered joy.\u2019 It\u2019s also seriously feminine.\n\nOn a different note, however, the current move among high-profile women is to don a tie \u2013 such as a man traditionally wears to the office \u2013 to glitzy events. Take Nicole Kidman, who looked sleek in a Saint Laurent trouser suit and tie at last month\u2019s Critics Choice Awards, and Cara Delevingne, who rocked hers with a red check shirt at the Thom Browne show during New York Fashion Week.\n\nWanting to see what all the fuss was about, this week I decided that, instead of a dress, I\u2019d put on a shirt and tie to go out to dinner. How did I feel? Well, not particularly sexy, though certainly empowered \u2013 it added an air of authority and swagger to how I carried myself. Sitting opposite a man also wearing a tie was very odd and, ultimately, the experience felt too corporate for a relaxed night out. I might keep my tie-wearing strictly to work events from now on.\n\nBut isn\u2019t it interesting that women are now wearing ties and suits and, as mentioned in last week\u2019s Chic List, more men are carrying handbags? When it comes to dressing, gender constructs are becoming more and more blurred. It will be fascinating to watch how this develops and I often wonder how much things will have changed by the time my 12-year-old son reaches adulthood.\n\nWhile in New York for Fashion Week I had lunch in one of my favourite spots, La Mercerie in SoHo (one for your next visit). And I\u2019m not the only fan \u2013 Martha Stewart was there recently, dressed in a sleek black knit to celebrate a friend\u2019s birthday. She was snapped with its executive chef Marie-Aude Rose (above), too.\n\nTAUPE AND GLORY \n\nWith Queen Camilla, the Duchess of Sussex and Zara Tindall all favouring its bags, brand Charlotte Elizabeth certainly has royal approval. I\u2019m loving its Pelham style (above) in new colourway taupe.\n\nSLEEVE IT OUT! \n\nThis knitted vest by Cefinn is just my shade of dusty pink.

Sustainability may be important, but it\u2019s never forced down your throat.\n\nFor this is a place designed for long, languorous lunches. The menu skips across Europe with joyous aplomb, lots of France and Italy with the odd dash of Spain. Head chef Oliver Gyde trained at Juliet\u2019s nearby sister site, The Woolpack, and it shows. There\u2019s a simplicity to the cooking, but an absolute skill and confidence, too. I\u2019m lunching with my old friend Matthew Fort, a local who has already been twice.\n\nAnd at the bar we bump into another old mucker, Dai Francis. He\u2019s waiting for his car to be fixed, but is easily persuaded to join our table.\n\nWe eat gildas \u2013 fat olives, smoked anchovies and pickled chillies impaled on a wooden pick, the essence of hearty umami. And crisp giardiniera, the pickled cauliflower, carrot and pepper mellow rather than aggressively sharp. Oeuf mayonnaise is as voluptuous as a Titian nude, with a fat anchovy draped on top. Bliss.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the chicken liver parfait, smooth and boozy. And beef tartare, robust and hand chopped, heavy on the gherkins and capers. A plate of pommes allumettes add slender crunch. There\u2019s a pair of charred lamb chops, blushing pink, with proper ovine bleat. And two plates of pasta \u2013 onion and pecorino-stuffed tortellini; cavatelli with a venison rag\u00f9 \u2013 that are as good as anything you\u2019d find anywhere in the country.

There was a crisis a year ago when my spouse was on business, and while they were working to get back home, our families stepped up to support us. A relative of my partner\u2019s showed particular concern, which surprised me. I care about this individual, but we were never especially tight. I sincerely appreciated their help and offered similar support if ever needed, and their tone curiously changed.\n\nShortly before my partner\u2019s return, this relative privately requested the \u201csupport\u201d I\u2019d promised: They confessed they were attracted to me and wanted a secret relationship! I was morally offended and didn\u2019t see how they figured I\u2019d agree. Aside from loving my spouse, I\u2019m notably old-fashioned. I\u2019m unapologetically closed-minded in my opinion that infidelity is just plain wrong, and I don\u2019t need to explain why. I kept calm and rebuffed them, and they seemed resigned. Later, they reappeared to remind me of the \u201csacrifice\u201d of their \u201csupport\u201d during my spouse\u2019s and my tough time and faulted (SET ITAL) me (END ITAL) for their feelings and for failing to discourage them (I\u2019d caught them staring in years past but purposely acted unaware to avoid awkwardness, and at those times, I informed my spouse).\n\nI\u2019m not responsible for this person\u2019s feelings and thought it underhanded to resort to these baseless claims. We both volleyed insults, ending with their vow to ruin my marriage; they then slandered me to my partner and their family, digging up an unrelated, settled disagreement to \u201cprove\u201d these lies. Their campaign went nowhere, but the exchange left me mortified.\n\nThis relative and I were never ride-or-die but their cruelty -- serving to hurt my partner and family as much as me -- is inexcusable. I informed my partner of the provoking event, and we\u2019ve kept it between us to spare needless hurt for other loved ones with their own struggles who don\u2019t need more drama. It\u2019s understood this relative is going through a lot and it can\u2019t be taken to heart, and I feel this is sufficient. Still, I\u2019m trying to reconcile with the breakdown between me and someone I\u2019ve called family for many years. I see them at gatherings now and don\u2019t know how to act. They keep their distance. Maybe they\u2019re quietly ashamed (or not). Even if they tried to fix what they did, I don\u2019t know if this betrayal can, or should, be fixed.\n\nAt the risk of sounding haughty, my partner\u2019s and my life choices have left us more accomplished than this family member. I maintain a professional demeanor and can indefinitely. It\u2019s hurtful to be near them. I can\u2019t view them the same way. I\u2019m in counseling for my own benefit (not specifically because of this). I\u2019ve discussed it there, and my therapist\u2019s best solution is to continue keeping distance. I do. I accept they\u2019re dealing with serious personal issues, but the heartbreak of their behavior is slow to dissipate.\n\nAnnie, I\u2019d greatly value your perspective. -- Fidelity-Shamed and Stunned\n\nDear Fidelity-Shamed: You\u2019ve handled this situation as maturely as anyone possibly could, shutting down what this family member inappropriately proposed and then being honest with your partner about what happened. For them to point the finger back at you and try to take down your character and your marriage says everything about who they are.\n\nBetrayal, especially from a family member, is painful, but you aren\u2019t under any obligation to reconcile things.

The company will also construct a separate, ADA-accessible ramp that will replace a paved path into the park from the South Taylor and Superior roads entrance. \n\nThe design, developed by engineering firm Donald Bohning & Associates, of Valley View, reflects the city\u2019s focus on enhancing the park\u2019s gathering spaces, preserving land and trees, and improving ADA access to the park\u2019s east entrance. \n\nIn addition to the tiered seating area and ADA ramp, Fabrizi will refurbish a set of two existing exterior staircases in the park located on Superior Road.\n\nThe project also adds a paved, 10-foot-wide path at the base of the sledding hill connecting the ADA ramp with the tiered seating, and new exterior lighting for the ramp and seating area. Accessible seating will be available at the top and bottom of the tiered-seating area. \n\nThe seating and ramp project is part of the Seren Administration\u2019s Cain Park Village project, a neighborhood redevelopment plan that includes the Taylor-Tudor redevelopment, and a set of planned improvements to the park and its surrounding area, including traffic calming on South Taylor Road, funded by a transportation grant the city won from NOACA, and improved amenities at the park funded by a federal National Park Service grant the city won in 2024.\n\nCedar-Lee garage has re-opened: The city of Cleveland Heights has announced the \u2018grand re-opening\u2019 of the Cedar-Lee Parking Garage as of Feb. 28.\n\nThe entire garage is now open to vehicles.

This potential public health disaster is a stark reminder of the importance of vaccinations and community health vigilance.\n\nAn Outbreak on the Rise\n\nThe state of Texas is currently witnessing a surge in measles cases, with reports indicating that thousands might be at risk of exposure. Local health officials have sounded the alarm, urging residents to ensure they are adequately vaccinated. According to NBC News, this outbreak has the potential to become one of the most significant health crises the state has faced in recent years.\n\nA Historical Lens\n\nHistorically, Texas has grappled with measles outbreaks, but advancements in medical science and vaccination efforts have drastically reduced their prevalence. However, recent declines in vaccination rates have left communities vulnerable once again. This retrogression highlights a crucial need for public health education and robust vaccination programs.\n\nCommunity Impact\n\nThe impact of this outbreak extends beyond immediate health risks. Community activities and school attendance are threatened as parents keep children home to avoid exposure. Local businesses, too, face challenges as they navigate increased absenteeism among their workforce. The broader economic repercussions are yet to unfold, but the social fabric of affected communities is undeniably strained.\n\nThe Science of Transmission\n\nMeasles, a highly contagious virus, spreads through respiratory droplets. It is known for its swift transmission among unvaccinated individuals, making prompt response and preventative measures crucial. Healthcare professionals are tirelessly working to contain the outbreak and are recommending immediate immunization for those without documentation of measles immunity.\n\nA Call for Action\n\nHealth authorities are focusing on rapid interventions to curb the outbreak\u2019s spread. Community leaders are urged to advocate for vaccination as a vital tool in the fight against measles. Meanwhile, residents are advised to report symptoms, such as fever and rash, to healthcare providers without delay.\n\nAs this situation unfolds, it acts as a microsocmic reflection of global health challenges where preventable diseases resurface due to lapses in preventive health measures. The current scenario in Texas underscores the stark reality that vigilance in public health cannot wane if communities are to resist and recover from such outbreaks.\n\nLet us hope that this opportunity acts as a catalyst for renewed commitment to vaccines, ensuring a healthier future for all.", "summary": "Texas faces a growing measles crisis with thousands potentially exposed.

They are 21st in points allowed, at 115.6 points per game, 18th in field goal percentage, 46.7%, and 29th in three-point defense, allowing 37.6% from behind the arc.\nThe Kings\u2019 frontcourt has been solid. Sabonis leads the team with 14.4 rebounds per game. Next, Keegan Murray is the blocks leader, averaging 0.9 per game. The perimeter defense has also been playing well, and five different Kings have averaged at least one steal, with Ellis leading the team with 1.4 per game.\nThis defense has been unimpressive, but the Rockets don\u2019t offer much on offense, so they have the advantage on this side of the court. This will be the X-factor in the game.\nThe Rockets\u2019 defense has been one of the best in the NBA. They are fifth in points allowed, 108.8 points per game, fifth in field goal defense, 45.3%, and fifth in three-point defense, 34.9% permitted % from behind the arc.\nSengun has been great as Houston\u2019s frontcourt leader. He does everything for the Rockets on offense and defense. He is the best rebounder on the team, averaging 10.6 per game. Amen Thompson and Tari Eason are up next as the block and steals leaders. Thompson averages 1.3 blocks, while Eason averages 1.9 steals per game.\nThis defense is one of the best and should be able to slow down the new-look Kings. Expect the Rockets to stifle the Kings at home on this side of the court.\nFinal Kings-Rockets Prediction & Pick\nThis game feels like a toss-up. The Rockets have the advantage at home and I trust this defense the most out of any of the units in this game. Jalen Green should engineer this offense to score enough points, and they should clamp down on the Kings and stifle Sabonis, LaVine, and DeRozan. The Rockets win and cover at home.\nFinal Kings-Rockets Prediction & Pick: Houston Rockets -4 (-110)", "summary": "The Kings have struggled to find consistency this season, while the Rockets have been one of the bigger surprise teams.

If Washington ever did play a good game \u2014 which has happened occasionally \u2014 it could not then follow up and build momentum in the next two or three games. This team hasn\u2019t been able to stack wins or get on prolonged winning streaks. The lack of quality depth on this roster has been a problem. Late-game execution in close contests has also been lacking. Washington has been competitive but ultimately not good enough to rise to a mid-tier level of performance in the Big Ten. The Huskies enter this game against Indiana needing at least two wins and very probably three to have any chance of qualifying for the upcoming Big Ten Tournament.\nRemember: The Big Ten Tournament, in this age of conference realignment and expansion, excludes the bottom three teams from its tournament. This is now a 15-school event, with the 16th, 17th, and 18th-place teams not invited. Washington is dead last, 18th place, in the Big Ten. It absolutely must win twice and probably needs to win three games to escape and find a way to get to the Big Ten tourney.

They beat Purdue, they beat Penn State, and they are making a run on the NCAA Tournament bubble. They have significantly improved their bubble position. They aren\u2019t likely to make the tournament. They aren\u2019t clearly on the bad side of the bubble. The fairest and most accurate way to characterize their situation is that they are right near the cut line, one way or another. They have the chance to either play their way in or play their way out. Given that Washington is the last-place team in the Big Ten, this certainly sets up as a game Indiana can and should win. The point spread is very small, so it\u2019s not as though Indiana has to do a ton of work. If it wins, the odds of not covering are low. Winning by at least three points should not be an overwhelmingly difficult task \u2014 not a piece of cake, but not an extraordinary undertaking, either.\nWhy Washington Will Cover The Spread/Win\nThe Huskies aren\u2019t good, but Indiana has consistently been inconsistent this season. If the Hoosiers have played well at times, they then lapse back into bad habits. This is what a bubble team is. This is what a bubble team does. Indiana is volatile and not very dependable. Washington is trying to extend its season by qualifying for the Big Ten Tournament. The Huskies have zero margin for error and know that if they lose this game, right here, they\u2019re done. That is powerful motivation to play well, play hard, and ultimately win this game against an opponent which will buckle if the opponent brings its A-game.\nFinal Indiana-Washington Prediction & Pick\nOur lean is to Washington, but we\u2019re not going to trust the Huskies here.

Experts Weigh in on Housing Market", "text": "Heading into March 2025, potential homebuyers are facing significant challenges such as high mortgage rates, rising home prices and inflation. Additionally, factors like the threat of tariffs further complicate the market, creating more obstacles for buyers.Why It MattersThe housing market is experiencing significant fluctuations, with interest rates remaining high and inflation impacting affordability. These factors have broader implications for potential homebuyers, influencing their ability to secure favorable mortgage rates and find affordable homes. External factors, such as tariffs on key materials, could also drive up housing costs, further complicating the market for buyers.Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for those who navigate the current conditions strategically.What To KnowThe current housing market presents both opportunities and challenges for potential buyers. Mortgage rates remain a pivotal factor for buyers and have remained high, which had led to a decrease in mortgage applications to start the year, as buyers were hesitant to commit to higher monthly payments.However, the Mortgage Bankers Association predicts that rates will gradually decline from 7 percent to 6.4 percent throughout 2025 and remain around 6.3 percent for 2026. With rates currently sitting at 6.75 percent, some buyers will want to take advantage of the recent decrease in rates, while others may choose to wait for further rate reductions before committing.In recent months, the U.S. housing market has experienced a slight uptick in inventory. This can mean more options to choose from, potentially reducing competition for each home. Zillow forecasts a 0.9 percent home value growth in 2025, indicating a relatively slow pace. This modest increase suggests that as more homes are becoming available, prices will rise at a slower rate.A Reuters poll suggests that housing affordability may see modest improvement this year, primarily due to anticipated interest rate cuts rather than an increased supply of homes. This implies that while financing may become slightly more accessible, the limited housing supply continues to pose challenges.Experts note economic conditions and policy decisions are also key factors to influencing the housing market. Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek that high interest rates and inflationary pressures are making it difficult for people \"to save for a down payment,\" which makes homeownership more challenging.Both Beene and Kevin Thompson, founder and CEO of 9i Capital Group, recognize the impact of external factors, such as tariffs, on housing costs. Beene warns that tariffs could drive up prices by thousands of dollars and Thompson emphasizes how rising material costs will force builders to pass those increases onto buyers. Ultimately, both suggest that the housing market in March will remain difficult for buyers.Despite these challenges, there are still opportunities for buyers who are willing to navigate the current market conditions. The Texas Real Estate Research Center told Newsweek buyers who have flexibility in negotiations or the ability to walk away from unfavorable deals will benefit most from shifting market conditions.Beene suggests homebuyers looking for new homes might benefit the most. He notes new home builds are being offered at more aggressive pricing, as these properties started production when housing was easier to move. And Thompson notes cash buyers have an advantage, as they do not rely on banks and have more pricing power in any market.What People Are SayingAlex Beene, financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek: \"The only type of buyer that may find value in the current housing market is one who can find a good deal and is willing to tolerate higher interest rates for a period of time before they start to decline. We are seeing some new builds with more aggressive pricing in many real estate markets, as these properties started production at a time when housing was easier to move. While it's still not the best time to buy, finding a new build at a lower price and promotional interest rate is the way to go until the broader market gets more financially reasonable for buyers.\"Kevin Thompson, founder and CEO of 9i Capital Group, told Newsweek: \"Cash buyers will always have an advantage\u2014especially now. They don't rely on banks, giving them more pricing power in any market. Meanwhile, the 10-year yield has dropped by about 40 basis points, pulling mortgage rates down with it. If you expect rates to rise again, now may be the time to lock in a lower mortgage rate.On the flip side, if you believe the economy is slowing, waiting could be the smarter move. Market uncertainty may bring down natural interest rates further, leading to softening prices in the months ahead.\"The Texas Real Estate Research Center told Newsweek: \"Buyers with flexibility, those who can take their time to negotiate a good price or simply walk away from a less attractive offer, are the ones who will benefit a lot from shifting market conditions. Even those who are pressed to find a house to buy, are in a better position to negotiate with the seller on price or non-price concessions.Buying a home is an extremely personal decision and should be based on the buyer's circumstances like cashflow and job stability. Also, many people enter the market from major life changes like marriage, growing or shrinking families. These and other factors determine whether it is a good time to buy.\"What Happens NextWhile the current housing market presents challenges, there are still opportunities for buyers who are willing to navigate the complexities. Looking ahead, potential homebuyers should monitor economic indicators, including Federal Reserve policies and potential tariff implementations, as these factors could influence mortgage rates and housing prices.", "summary": "Considering buying a house in March 2025?

Those who fall for them can end up compromising their identity information if they engage with the fraudsters.What To KnowDrivers nationwide have been hit with texts claiming they have unpaid toll fees, including in Massachusetts, Texas and California.TxTag Scam Texts Hit Texas DriversThe Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) has noted an uptick in the scam texts, which began in spring and have escalated since September, TxDOT said in a press release. The texts claim to come from TxTag, a toll revenue service operated by TxDOT.Although TxTag does text its customers, it will not send texts regarding final payments or past due balances. TxTag will text or email customers about other matters, but a customer must opt in to receive these messages. Any real texts from TxTag will come from the number 22498.Newsweek reached out to TxDOT via email for comment.EZDriveMA Scam Texts Hit Massachusetts DriversOn the East Coast, Massachusetts drivers are facing a similar scam.E-ZPass or EZDriveMA, is Massachusetts' toll system.

A decade later, armed with ballooning assets and pre-IPO stakes in software companies like Demandware and Brightcove, Taneja and then-partner Neil Sequeira set up shop in a charming yellow building with white trim on University Avenue in Palo Alto. There, GC quickly made its mark in the Bay Area, cutting software deals reminiscent of its East Coast successes while also forging deep ties with Y Combinator that paid off.

Though Sequeira left in 2015 to start his own shop, GC today has a sprawling team with 20 managing directors, over $30 billion in assets, and offices from San Francisco to Bengaluru. It has also expanded far beyond traditional venture investing. As we noted in October after talking with Taneja for a podcast, the firm is almost unrecognizable from its former self.

Jolie", "text": "Some of Hollywood\u2019s brightest stars are getting ready for a big night at the Oscars \u2013 with first-timers like Ariana Grande, Sebastian Stan, Monica Barbaro and, of course, Demi Moore waiting to find out if they\u2019ll be taking home one of the industry\u2019s top accolades.\n\nBut, of course, not everyone will be feeling quite so jubilant.\n\nWith only a handful of slots to fill, some of the biggest and most-celebrated performances of the past 12 months have gone unchecked by the Academy, with cinephiles on social media already going off about this year\u2019s most notable \u201csnubs\u201d.\n\nHere are 11 of the most notable ones...\n\nDaniel Craig\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Adrien Brody, Colman Domingo and Ralph Fiennes\u2019 spots in the Best Actor category were pretty much dead certs by the time the Oscar nominations rolled around, leaving a few big names competing for the one remaining spot.\n\nIn the end, it went to Sebastian Stan for his performance as Donald Trump in The Apprentice, but there were a fair few people disappointed the distinction didn\u2019t go to Daniel Craig.\n\nStill, given how open Sebastian has been about the difficulties he faced putting The Apprentice in front of an audience in the current climate, we\u2019re glad that more people might now be afforded the chance to see it.\n\nDanielle Deadwyler\n\nAmerican performer Danielle Deadwyler received a wave of acclaim for her performance in the August Wilson adaptation The Piano Lesson.\n\nWhile the film itself failed to score much awards season buzz, fans had hoped Danielle might scrape through in the Best Supporting Actress category for her role as Berniece, a woman determined to hold onto her late father\u2019s piano when the rest of her family are hoping to sell it.\n\nThe snub stings twice as hard as it marks the second time an Oscar-worthy performance from Danielle has ultimately gone ignored by the Academy, after 2022\u2019s Till was similarly overlooked. \n\nDenzel Washington\n\nConsidering the original Gladiator was a Best Picture recipient, it might come as a surprise to some to see the sequel picked up just one nomination in 2025, in the Best Costume Design category.\n\nLead actor Paul Mescal had been among those to be singled out for praise when the action-packed epic hit cinemas last year, but it wqas Denzel Washington who was really being tipped for awards buzz.\n\nAfter scoring a nomination at the Golden Globes last month, however, both the Baftas (who, interestingly, have never nominated Denzel in his entire 40-year screen career) and Oscars ended up him paying him dust, making him one of the year\u2019s most noticeable awards season snubs.\n\nTrent Reznor and Atticus Ross\n\nIt\u2019s rare that you\u2019ll find outcry over a snub in the Best Score category \u2013 but then again, it\u2019s rare a score will capture people\u2019s attention in the way that Challengers\u2019 did.\n\nThe Nine Inch Nails musicians delivered one of last year\u2019s most iconic contributions to the world of cinema when they scored Luca Guadagnino\u2019s tennis-themed romance drama Challengers, perfectly amping up the tension between its central trio with their musical output.\n\nWe\u2019re sure we\u2019re not the only ones confused to see the score \u2013 which won a Golden Globe just a matter of weeks ago \u2013 not even nominated for an Oscar when it felt like such a shoo-in.\n\nMargaret Qualley\n\nThe Substance has been the surprise hit of 2025\u2019s awards season, and we\u2019re over the moon to see not just Demi Moore landing an acting nomination, but Coralie Fargeat\u2019s name popping up on the Best Director shortlist.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s no denying that The Substance was a two-header, and while we\u2019re over the moon for Demi scoring her first Oscar nomination at this stage of her career, we were still a little sad there wasn\u2019t space for Margaret Qualley in the Best Supporting Actress category.\n\nThe Maid star has made no secret of what she put herself through to help bring the character of Sue (and, perhaps more impressively, Monstro Elisasue) to life, and she was the perfect foil to her Golden Globe-winning co-star\u2019s character in the graphic body horror.\n\nMarianne Jean-Baptiste\n\nShe may not have had the fanfare and loud push behind her that the likes of Wicked\u2019s Cynthia Erivo or even Demi Moore have had over the last few months, but Marianne Jean-Baptiste had quietly been climbing up the ranks as a contender for a Best Actress nomination thanks to her role in Mike Leigh\u2019s Hard Truths.\n\nWhen Hard Truths premiered at Toronto Film Festival towards the end of last year, Marianne\u2019s performance as a pessimistic woman struggling to connect with those closest to her saw her being met with a wave of praise, which has translated into recognition from the Baftas and Critics\u2019 Choice Awards.\n\nThe British performer was nominated for an Oscar once before for her role in another of Mike Leigh\u2019s projects, Secrets & Lies.\n\nPamela Anderson\n\nAlright, we know this one was always going to be a long shot, but \u201cOscar nominee Pamela Anderson\u201d had such a ring to it that we couldn\u2019t help crossing our fingers that this could be her year.\n\nOscar nomination or not, it\u2019s still been wonderful to see Pammy\u2019s performance in The Last Showgirl get so much attention, while the woman herself has already given an admirable and dignified response to her so-called \u201csnub\u201d.\n\nStanley Tucci\n\nConclave went into this year\u2019s Oscars race as a favourite, and ultimately received eight nominations, including recognition for cast members Ralph Fiennes and Isabella Rossellini.\n\nFor the past few months, Stanley Tucci had been hovering around the middle of the list of favourites to score a Best Supporting Actor nod (which would have marked his second ever nomination, after 2009\u2019s The Lovely Bones) but sadly, it wasn\u2019t to be.\n\nHe\u2019ll just have to make do with being the entire internet\u2019s imaginary husband instead, we suppose\u2026\n\nDenis Villeneuve\n\nWith 10 slots in the Best Picture category and only five in Best Director, there\u2019s always going to be someone who winds up disappointed.\n\nBut considering everything that Denis Villeneuve had to contend with to make Dune: Part Two the epic that it was (it\u2019s one of the year\u2019s most-nominated films thanks to recognition in more technical categories, which is no mean feat for a sequel), a Best Director nomination would have been fitting.\n\nAngelina Jolie\n\nThe Best Actress category was absolutely heaving with competition this year, and we understand there can\u2019t be room for everyone, but Angelina Jolie\u2019s major comeback to the cinema world after a few years away felt so triumphant that an Oscar nomination would have been more fitting \u2013 especially given the performance she delivers in Maria.\n\nWhile this may not be the year the former Best Supporting Actress recipient wins over the Academy yet again, there\u2019s no denying that it\u2019s great to have Angelina back on the big scren, and we can\u2019t wait to see what this unusual thinker chooses for her next project.\n\nSelena Gomez\n\nEmilia P\u00e9rez may not have been to everyone\u2019s tastes (and its favour has only fallen since awards season began...), but do a quick search on social media for Selena Gomez\u2019s name, and you\u2019ll see it for yourself, there are still a lot of people seriously pissed off that she didn\u2019t make the cut.\n\nThe divisive Netflix musical is, of course, this year\u2019s most-nominated film at the Oscars, with 13 nods in total.\n\nHad Selena been recognised alongside co-star Zoe Salda\u00f1a, that number would have matched Emilia P\u00e9rez with Titanic, All About Eve and La La Land as the joint most-nominated films in history.", "summary": "Oscars night is just a few weeks awaySome of Hollywood\u2019s brightest stars are getting ready for a

Nominations", "text": "It\u2019s almost time for the biggest night in British music.\n\nYes, on Saturday night, the 2025 Brit Awards are taking place at The O2 Arena in London, with Charli XCX\u2019s looking poised to sweep the board off the back of her hit album Brat, with five nominations in total.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s fair to say that there were a few curveballs when the full list of nominations was unveiled last month.\n\nWhether it\u2019s unexpected inclusions or shock omissions, this year\u2019s shortlist has given us plenty to talk about.\n\nHere are nine of the biggest surprises and snubs from this year\u2019s list...\n\nSNUB \u2013 Ariana Grande\n\nInternational Artist Of The Year\n\nYes, the Brit Awards are all about homegrown talent, but we have to admit that the most glaring omission from this year\u2019s list of nominees originally hails from across the pond.\n\nOf course, the International Artist category is especially stacked in 2025, given how many incredible US artists dominated in the last year, but we\u2019re still surprised to see the Brits not giving any love to Ariana Grande off the back of her chart-topping Eternal Sunshine.\n\nThen again, the same weekend as the Brits, she is in the running for her first Oscar off the back of her performance in Wicked, so we\u2019re sure it\u2019s not something she\u2019s paying all that much mind to...\n\nSURPRISE \u2013 Ezra Collective\n\nBest New Artist\n\nIt\u2019s been an incredible year for Ezra Collective, who are one of the most-recognised acts at the 2025 Brits with a hefty four nominations.\n\nFor those not aware, Ezra Collective is a British five-piece best known for putting a unique, contemporary spin on jazz music.\n\nBut considering how well-established the group already is \u2013 they even won the Mercury Prize back in 2023 \u2013 they weren\u2019t an act we were especially expecting to see on the Best New Artist shortlist.\n\nSURPRISE \u2013 Rachel Chinouriri\n\nArtist Of The Year\n\nWe should specify that this is a very good surprise, but a surprise all the same.\n\nRachel Chinouriri is an act we\u2019ve been banging on about to anyone who\u2019d listen for ages now, with her debut release What A Devastating Turn Of Events being one of our must-listen albums of the past year.\n\nWhen she was overlooked at last year\u2019s Mercury Prize, we were pretty gutted, so imagine our glee when she secured not just a Best New Artist nod, but also a mention in the Artist Of The Year category, joining more established names like Dua Lipa, Charli XCX, Fred again.. and Sam Fender. \n\nSNUB \u2013 Blossoms\n\nBritish Group Of The Year\n\nWe\u2019re going to be honest, there was so much hype around Blossoms\u2019 chart-topping release Gary towards the end of last year, we were quietly convinced that they would end up on the Album Of The Year shortlist, if not just British Group.\n\nInstead, the indie five-piece failed to pick up a single nomination for Gary, which was named after an eight-foot fiberglass gorilla that was stolen from a garden centre in Lancashire a year before the album\u2019s release.\n\nAfter entering the charts at number one, Gary was one of last year\u2019s highest-selling albums when it came to physical sales, so Blossoms\u2019 absence from the Brits list this year is a curious one.\n\nSNUB \u2013 Laura Marling\n\nArtist Of The Year\n\nLaura Marling has been a Brits darling in the past, famously beating stiff competition from Cheryl, Ellie Goulding and Paloma Faith in the now-defunct Best British Female category over a decade ago.\n\nHer latest album, Patters In Repeat, was once again massively well-received from critics and praised for Laura\u2019s signature songwriting and storytelling, so we were a little perplexed at her not landing a single nomination in 2025.\n\nSNUB \u2013 Cat Burns\n\nArtist Of The Year\n\nFour years after the release of her breakout single Go (and two years after it took on a new life and climbed its way to the top of the charts), Cat Burns released her debut album Early Twenties over the summer.\n\nEarly Twenties was largely praised thanks to Cat\u2019s frank and confessional songwriting, and even scored her a Mercury Prize nomination. Still, apparently this wasn\u2019t enough to translate to a Brit nomination \u2013 either in the 10-strong Artist Of The Year category or any of the more genre-specific awards.\n\nCat was previously nominated for three Brits back in 2023, including in the inaugural Best Pop/R&B Act category, which was later split into two separate awards.\n\nSURPRISE \u2013 Adrianne Lenker\n\nInternational Artist Of The Year\n\nAbsolutely no offence to Adrianne Lenker \u2013 we mean you no disrespect. But last year was a huge one for international stars, with US talent largely dominating the UK singles chart in 2024.\n\nSo, Adrianne making the cut over some more obvious choices was definitely unexpected \u2013 great as it is to see different types of artists getting recognition at major events like the Brits.\n\nSNUB \u2013 Flo \n\nBritish Group\n\nLittle Mix kicked off a fabulous trend with their seminal Best British Group win in 2022, and the two subsequent awards in this category have also both going to the female-led bands Wet Leg and Wolf Alice.\n\nThis year, The Last Dinner Party look poised to continue the trend, and that\u2019s great, but we\u2019d love former Rising Star winners Flo to have continued the torch for more traditional girl bands off the back of their debut album last year.\n\nIt\u2019s not all bad news for Flo, though, as they are still in the running for the fan-voted Best R&B Act prize.\n\nSURPRISE \u2013 Sam Ryder\n\nSong Of The Year\n\nYou\u2019re Christmas To Me might seem like an unlikely pick to sit alongside hits by Charli XCX, Dua Lipa and, indeed, The Beatles in the Brits\u2019 Song Of The Year category, but this is one surprise nomination we actually can explain.\n\nUnlike the other categories, Best British Song is determined by sales.\n\nSo, given the push that Sam Ryder\u2019s Christmas song was given by Amazon Music (where the festive track is an exclusive, meaning you\u2019ve perhaps heard it when you\u2019ve asked Alexa to play Christmas music and literally nowhere else) on its release towards the end of 2023 \u2013 putting it just within the eligibility period for the Brits \u2013 that would explain how it\u2019s sneaked its way onto the shortlist.", "summary": "The Brits are backIt\u2019s almost time for the biggest night in British music.\n\nYes, on Saturday night, the 2025 Brit Awards are taking place at The O2 Arena in London, with\u00a0Charli XCX\u2019s looking poised to sweep the board off the back of her hit album Brat, with five nominations in total.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s fair to say that there were a few curveballs when the full list of nominations was unveiled last month.\n\nWhether it\u2019s unexpected inclusions or shock omissions, this year\u2019s shortlist has given us plenty to talk about.\n\nHere are nine of the biggest surprises and snubs from this year\u2019s list...\n\nSNUB \u2013 Ariana GrandeInternational Artist Of The Year\n\nAriana Grande performing on Saturday Night Live last yearYes, the Brit Awards are all about homegrown talent, but we have to admit that the most glaring omission from this year\u2019s list of nominees originally hails from across the pond.\n\nOf course, the International Artist category is especially stacked in 2025, given how many incredible US artists dominated in the last year, ", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/brit-awards-2025-nominations-biggest-snubs-surprises_uk_67c1df58e4b0bf54864079cb", "image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/67927a8716000014003d3b9e.jpg?cache=L7G2Nf6ilP&ops=1778_1000", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 07:00:04", "author": "Daniel Welsh", "authors": ["Daniel Welsh"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.354}, {"id": 295590820, "title": "How a 'Beast Games' crew member was nearly crushed on set: 'I don't want to die'", "text": "Sam had been on the set of \"Beast Games\" for only a few hours when disaster struck.It was his first day as a freelance crew member on the Toronto set of the new game show from the YouTuber MrBeast. He was helping break down the set labeled Beast City \u2014 a miniature town with a basketball court, tables, cabins, and a tower on the northern side.He weaved in and out of the set props while wrapping up cables. At one point, he walked into a section of the tower \u2014 a giant rectangular four-story structure that looked like it was made of concrete.When he exited the tower, he collapsed and hit his head. He couldn't move his arm and felt a searing pain in his shoulder.He started coughing up blood. \"I don't want to die,\" a witness recalled him saying.Sam didn't know it at the time, but workers had been disassembling the tower above him, and a dislodged section had fallen and sliced his left shoulder. He spent eight days in the hospital, where doctors removed his spleen and performed reconstructive surgery on his shoulder. He suffered a lung contusion, a hemothorax, and damage to his ribs, scapula, spine, and clavicle, medical records show. He said that it took months of physical therapy to regain use of his arm and that his surgeon said he couldn't return to work until spring at the earliest.An executive producer visited him in the hospital and provided an envelope containing DoorDash and Uber gift cards totaling roughly $1,000, he said. A person close to the production said that it was something he'd asked for and that he was repeatedly offered other forms of support. Sam said he didn't remember asking for the gift cards and was underwhelmed. \"Accidents on sets happen, but this one seemed preventable,\" he told Business Insider in an interview. He requested Business Insider use only his first name to protect his identity, which is known to BI.\"If it was really well organized or well communicated, this wouldn't happen in the first place,\" he said. He said he wanted MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, to publicly acknowledge the incident and ensure something like it wouldn't happen again.In early August, The New York Times reported claims from over a dozen anonymous contestants of inadequate living conditions and safety issues during the shooting of a promotional video in Las Vegas. Five contestants filed paperwork in September seeking class-action status against Donaldson and the production companies behind the show, accusing them of \"dangerous circumstances and conditions\" on the Las Vegas set. According to a summary online, the case status is pending, with the next hearing set for March.Some crew members told Rolling Stone that on-set conditions in Toronto had improved, but that the work environment was \"loose\" with safety.After BI contacted the YouTuber's team for comment on this story, Sam said a representative from production contacted him, saying they were \"here to support me and provided me some things I can't share.\" He declined to share further details.\"Beast Games\" is a 10-episode reality series hosted and executive-produced by Donaldson. It was filmed from late August to September in a closed airplane construction facility and the company Blink49 ran production. The show involved 1,000 contestants competing in outlandish and risky challenges to win a $5 million prize. Its episodes were released on Amazon Prime Video from December through February, and Amazon has said it was the second-most-viewed original series of 2024. A representative from Amazon MGM Studios declined to comment on this story. Blink49 did not respond to requests for comment.Sam's first and last day of work on \"Beast Games\" was September 11. BI pieced together what happened that day based on interviews with Sam, 24, and two other \"Beast Games\" crew members who witnessed or were aware of the incident, along with medical records, emails, and other documents.The tower on set was covered in roughly 8-by-8-foot wood squares made to look like concrete, a supervisor who was also a \"Beast Games\" production assistant said. Each square was about 4 or 5 inches thick and seemed to weigh a couple hundred pounds. On the show, the tower was used for games like throwing a ball into an oversize cup on the ground floor and catching a ball that fell from holes in the ceiling. The structure appeared sturdy, surviving a record-breaking rainstorm on July 16 that flooded the set.We spent $14,000,000 building a city in a field for the contestants in Beast Games to live and compete in.. December 19th is almost here \ud83e\udd70 pic.twitter.com/gFxjTq5CFDAround 11:30 a.m., Sam said he was untangling a \"jungle of wires\" in the basement section of the tower. Some of the cables were still attached to light fixtures outside the tower, so he stepped out of the west exit, he said. \"There was nothing to block that off. There was no dedicated path. There was nothing to indicate that at all,\" he said.At the same time, workers were attaching the squares to a boom lift, removing them from their steel frames, then lowering them to the floor, two people on-site that day said. At one point, the crew appeared to detach a section on the third floor without the boom lift attached, the supervisor said. That free square fell on Sam.\"The third-floor square had been dislodged and pushed out,\" said the supervisor, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of damage to his career. \"I saw it come down. I knew immediately this was really bad \u2014 this was one of those moments where things change.\"He said he rushed to Sam's side and \"immediately radioed for a medic,\" describing a \"bloody\" scene. \"I remember when I was by Sam's side looking up and seeing someone's head popping up out of the empty hole\" where the square had been, he said.A person close to the production said that Sam wasn't using the \"established\" path to exit the tower and that it was technically a prohibited area. Sam and the supervisor said there were no indications on the ground floor that there was work being done above them.\"I don't remember seeing any pylons, a guarded-off area, or anyone telling us that they were moving walls,\" Sam said. He and the supervisor said they had taken the same path underneath the boom lift multiple times since they'd started their shifts at 8 a.m. Sam said he was wearing normal gear for a construction site, including a hard hat and steel-toe boots.An ambulance arrived on the scene within minutes and rushed Sam to the emergency room of the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, which has the largest trauma center in Canada.The production crews halted work for the day while Ontario's labor ministry \u2014 Canada's agency that protects workers \u2014 and the police visited the site to investigate.Sam said his family contacted multiple lawyers in September regarding any legal action they could take and were told he couldn't sue his employer because he took a payment from the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board, which provides insurance benefits for injured workers.The CBC reported three months later, in December, that the Ontario labor ministry was investigating an \"industrial accident\" in which a crew member \"was injured by falling wood on September 11 on the set.\"Sam said his last contact with the labor agency was in January. A spokesperson for the ministry told BI that it was notified of an incident on September 11 in North York in which a worker suffered injuries caused by a piece of falling wood and that it issued a \"requirement\" to the production companies not to disturb the site of the incident. The spokesperson said the agency would not provide further information because the investigation was ongoing.Sam said he was worried about his job prospects. He had wanted to be a part of the film industry since he was 10 and first saw \"Terminator 2\" and \"Indiana Jones.\" But his injury has made him scared to go back to a set.Sam told BI that more than anything, he wanted his incident publicly acknowledged and thoroughly investigated.\"I still can't use my left arm like I was able to,\" Sam said. \"At the moment, I can only lift maybe 2 pounds with it. I'm working with physio to hopefully get it back to normal. I lost my spleen, so I'm also immunocompromised.\"He told BI that seeing MrBeast take accountability, in particular, would mean a lot. He said Donaldson isn't the \"company or people that rigged the wall,\" but he's the \"face and the captain of the team.\"", "summary": "A 24-year-old crew member had been on the set of MrBeast's \"Beast Games\" for only a few hours when disaster struck.", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/beast-games-accident-crew-member-injured-toronto-set-mrbeast-2025-3", "image": "https://i.insider.com/67be2c39b8b41a9673f8f4a4?width=1200&format=jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 10:05:02", "author": "Steven Asarch", "authors": ["Steven Asarch"], "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.355}, {"id": 295590822, "title": "We went to one of tech's most exclusive conferences, where Prince Harry and Kamala Harris mingled", "text": "What do Prince Harry, Kamala Harris, Bill Gurley, and Serena Williams have in common? Aside from all being famous, they were at this year's Upfront Summit, the glitzy annual invite-only conference hosted by Upfront Ventures that aspires to be nothing like most of the stodgy events dotting the conference circuit.The summit is held at a unique location yearly, such as the Rose Bowl, Malibu Farm, or the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures. This year's event was at the Intuit Dome, the new arena in Inglewood, CA, that is home to the NBA Clippers. There was pickup basketball at lunch, two illuminated hoops on the stage, and booming speaker introductions by the Clippers' public address announcer.Though the theme was ostensibly basketball, the more overriding one onstage and in conversations at couches and tables on the outskirts of the area was the uneasy duality of the current tech market. On the one hand, venture investors are enamored of generative AI, which many see as a once-in-a-generation moneymaking bonanza bigger than the mobile phone. Megafunds like Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst keep raising billions more to pile into the biggest AI startups.\"This is a unique moment,\" said Bill Gurley, general partner at Benchmark who backed startups like Uber and Zillow, in an interview on stage. \"AI is the exact event every founder and [general partner] dreams of.\"On the other hand, most VCs have been unable to return much capital to their limited partners because the IPO market has been slow to recover, and the M&A market has been quiet. Many startups have been going out of business as capital runs dry. There is also widespread concern those megafunds could be bad for the industry.\"I am a short-term pessimist and a long-term optimist,\" said Pat Grady, partner at Sequoia Capital, in an on-stage interview. \"I think we're going to have a culling of the herd because people got away from the original spirit of venture capital, which is helping founders build legendary companies, and they got into the asset management business.\"General partners in a less enviable position than Grady pony up thousands of dollars to attend Upfront, and they are not paying for the food (which is always excellent) or the speakers (mostly top-caliber). Their return on investment is meeting the endowment heads and chief investment officers from places like the University of Michigan and Mizuho, who can write checks into their next fund.Getting those LPs to make commitments proved frustratingly slow again this year, especially for less-established players, according to multiple VCs and LPs I spoke to at the conference. Two LPs said they were impressed by the many funds they met with, but when I asked which funds they would invest in, they said they were not deploying any capital right now.As the gravity of tech has been moving rightward with Donald Trump's return to the White House, the Upfront Summit retained its bluer, California vibe. There were appearances from Chelsea Clinton and Gov. Gavin Newsom, who received a frosty reception from some in the audience still upset about his handling of last month's catastrophic wildfires in LA.

Harris's appearance was kept highly under wraps, and few at the conference knew she was there.Harris, who served as AI czar during the Biden administration, was eager to hear about where the technology is heading, according to those in the room. She will also be speaking at HumanX in less than two weeks, an AI conference in Las Vegas.another epic #upfrontsummit - hard to believe it keeps getting better every yearthanks for your generosity @msuster - our industry is better and more connected thanks to you and your epic team \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe pic.twitter.com/VzRAGgWZYkMark Suster, managing partner of Upfront Ventures, created the Upfront Summit over a decade ago to put LA's tech scene on the map, and the event has always served as a love letter to Los Angeles. This year, the wildfires loomed large, with many there, including Suster, affected by the fires that burned through Pacific Palisades, where many in LA's tech community live.A teary-eyed Suster took to the stage to ask for donations for fire relief and raised over $130,000. Paris Hilton closed out the summit with Tim Cadogan, CEO of GoFundMe, and a somber panel on rebuilding.Afterward, investors, founders, and limited partners mingled over tacos, BBQ chicken, and funnel cake at a glitzy closing party on the Clippers' hardwood court.

Since 1941, the warfighting concept of America, Britain and other Western nations has been to maintain relatively small armies backed by copious amounts of airpower. The concept eventually worked in World War II. It might have worked in the Cold War to repel a massive Soviet ground invasion of Europe.But the air war over Ukraine raises doubts about this approach. If Ukrainian S-300 and Patriot anti-aircraft missiles can destroy Russian planes, then couldn't Russian missiles do the same to NATO planes? Ukraine claims 369 Russian warplanes have been shot down as of February 2025, with most claimed by missiles rather than Ukraine's small fleet of fighter jets.That's why Western experts are paying close attention to how Russia has managed to make its air force relevant to the ground war. Much like the Russian war machine in general, the Russian air force is now emphasizing brute-force tactics that rely on massive amounts of bombs rather than accuracy. Instead of running the gauntlet of Ukrainian air defenses as they drop their bombs, Russian jets safely orbit up to 60 miles behind the Russian front line \u2014 out of range of Ukrainian long-range surface-to-air missiles \u2014 and lob glide bombs. These are low-budget guided weapons that mate a conventional iron bomb with a satellite-guidance system, and aerodynamic fins to control the bomb's trajectory.Russian UPMK glide bombs lack in accuracy compared to their Western counterparts such as the US Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM). But Russia doesn't care. The giant FAB-1500 \u2014 a 1.5-ton glide bomb \u2014 or the 3.4-ton FAB-5000 have such a large blast radius that even a near miss will destroy Ukrainian trenches and bunkers. It's the same sort of approach long practiced by Russian artillery: saturation bombardment to pulverize enemy defenses and rattle soldiers inside before the assault troops go in.Ukrainian troops have yet to find an effective defense against glide bombs; moving air defenses forward to fire at a launch aircraft also risks systems like Patriot that are in short supply. Instead, \"they have been pushed to completely avoid observation of their positions, to disperse or seek concealment underground, and to rely on uncrewed or autonomous systems to keep and kill the enemy at arm's length,\" Watling and Reynolds wrote.The Ukraine war has shown the biggest shortcoming of precision-guided munitions: they are so expensive that nations only procure small numbers, which are quickly depleted during a long war. Because glide bombs use cheap components \u2014 old-fashioned iron bombs and inexpensive navigation systems \u2014 Russia can easily mass produce them. \"The rise in UMPK glide bomb production from 40,000 units in 2024 to 70,000 units anticipated in 2025, has significantly increased the number of Ukrainian troops killed during defensive operations,\" RUSI noted.RUSI recommends that NATO increase its stockpiles and manufacturing capacity for stand-off weapons like JDAMs and the Joint Standoff Weapon made by Raytheon (JDAM bombs cost around $20,000 each). In addition, NATO air forces need more long-range air-to-air missiles: Russian fighters have had success in suppressing Ukrainian airpower by using long-range missiles such as the R-77-1, with a range of more than 62 miles.Given the ferocious consumption of munitions seen in Ukraine, procuring mass quantities is only viable if the price is right. \"Increasing stockpiles and the capacity to produce long-range air-to-air munitions and stand-off strike weapons at as low a cost as possible should be critical priorities for the force,\" RUSI argued.The Ukraine war offers one bit of consolation for NATO. The fact that Russia had restored some effectiveness to air force suggests that NATO's emphasis on airpower is still relevant. \"The disproportionate impact of the VKS, despite the generally poor performance of Russian airpower, validates the importance placed on air power across NATO,\" RUSI concluded.Michael Peck is a defense writer whose work has appeared in Forbes, Defense News, Foreign Policy magazine, and other publications.

Austin III, who are all either Democrats or served in Democrat administrations \u2014 signed a letter saying they are \u201cdeeply alarmed\u201d by the firings.\n\n\u201cWe write to urge the U.S. Congress to hold Mr. Trump to account for these reckless actions and to exercise fully its Constitutional oversight responsibilities,\u201d they said in the letter, which was predictably sent to legacy news media outlets.\n\nA senior defense official told Breitbart News, \u201cThis is a typical move by the left. Whenever they have something that\u2019s bad news for them, or something that they want to accelerate, they\u2019ll get former officials to line up, and usually these letters are written by liberal think-tanks who then circulate them for signature.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the swampiest of the swampy signing this letter,\u201d the official added.\n\nLast week, Trump fired Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Charles \u201cCQ\u201d Brown and \u2014 via Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth \u2014 Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti, Air Force Vice Chief of Staff Gen. James Slife, and the top judge advocate generals for the Army, Navy, and Air Force.\n\nAll of those military officers served at the pleasure of the president and can be replaced at any time, per the president\u2019s commander-in-chief authority under Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution. However, the former defense secretaries complained that Trump \u201coffered no justification for his actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs former Secretaries of Defense, we call on both the House and the Senate to hold immediate hearings to assess the national security implications of Mr. Trump\u2019s dismissals,\u201d they wrote, and demanded that the Trump administration \u201cjustify each firing.\u201d\n\nThey also called on the Senate to refuse to confirm any new Department of Defense nominees, including Brown\u2019s nominated replacement, Air Force Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Dan Caine.\n\nThe senior defense official noted that the signatories of the letter are all Democrats or anti-Trump, and include some who were either fired or fell under congressional investigation themselves.\n\nPerry, a Democrat who served in the Clinton administration, fell under congressional scrutiny in the aftermath of the Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia that led to the deaths of 19 airmen and 498 others injured. Senior Pentagon leaders were warned of a threat eight days before the attack.\n\nPanetta, a Democrat who served as CIA director and defense secretary in the Obama administration, was one of the signatories of the letter signed by 51 former intelligence officials who falsely claimed that the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation. He has, to date, never retracted his endorsement of that letter, despite the FBI confirming that the laptop was indeed real and not Russian disinformation.\n\nThe senior defense official called Panetta signing the letter \u201ca joke because he is one of the leaders of Hunter Biden cover up letter.\u201d The official noted that Trump has pulled the security clearances of signatories of that letter.\n\nHagel is a Republican but served in the Obama administration and was himself fired after two years by former President Barack Obama over policy disagreements.\n\nMattis, who served in the first Trump administration, never officially confirmed his political affiliation but as defense secretary wanted to bring in Democrat Michele Flournoy as his deputy and surrounded himself with anti-Trump Democrats as his top advisers. He was also fired \u2014 or, forced to resign \u2014 by Trump over policy disagreements.\n\nAustin is a Democrat who served as former President Joe Biden\u2019s defense secretary and fell under congressional investigation after it was discovered that he hid several hospitalizations from Biden and even his own deputy, leaving a break in the chain of command and risking the nation\u2019s security. He was never held accountable for that, nor the botched Afghanistan withdrawal, which saw the deaths of 13 American service members.\n\nNotably, the living former defense secretaries who did not sign the letter were all Republicans \u2014 Mark Esper, Robert Gates, and William Cohen.\n\nDespite the signatories\u2019 own failures and transgressions that led to the deaths of troops, they accused Trump of weakening \u201cnational security.\u201d\n\nThey also claimed, \u201cTalented Americans may be far less likely to choose a life of military service if they believe they will be held to a political standard.\u201d\n\nRecent figures by the Army and Navy actually show that military recruitment has only gone up during Trump\u2019s election in November.\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019s Kristina Wong on \u201dX\u201d, Truth Social, or on Facebook.", "summary": "A group of five partisan former defense secretaries \u2014 including one who signed the discredited letter calling the Hunter Biden laptop Russian disinformation \u2014 are calling on Congress to hold hearings on President Donald Trump's firing of top generals.\n\n\nThe post Five Partisan Ex-Defense Secretaries \u2014 Including a Hunter Biden Laptop Letter Signer \u2014 Call for Hearings on Trump Firing Generals appeared first on Breitbart.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/02/28/five-partisan-ex-defense-secretaries-call-hearings-trump-firing-generals/", "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/02/Donald-Trump-2-640x335.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 01:14:31", "author": "Kristina Wong", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.182}, {"id": 295590814, "title": "DOGE is on a cutting spree &mdash; and Social Security workers warn it's going to affect your benefits", "text": "Delayed payments, longer wait times: Cuts to the Social Security Administration's workforce will have a detrimental effect on the benefits millions of Americans rely on every month, several agency employees said.\"Put bluntly, the ramifications of downsizing SSA are enormous,\" an agency employee told Business Insider. \"Because it'll take two to three times longer to work these cases, some people will die before a decision is reached.\"The Social Security Administration sent an email to employees on Thursday offering voluntary early retirements as part of a \"restructuring that will include significant workforce reductions.\" One internal memo seen by BI on Friday listed two dozen senior staff who had already resigned.BI spoke to five SSA employees who received the emails, granting them anonymity to speak freely about changes within their agency.They said they're concerned that slashing the agency's workforce will hinder critical functions, including causing overpayments, increased call wait times, and potential payment delays for older Americans and those with disabilities who receive Social Security benefits.These cuts are part of President Donald Trump and the DOGE office's larger goals to reduce government waste and slash the federal workforce. The administration has already terminated thousands of workers across a range of agencies. Elon Musk, who is leading DOGE, has criticized the Social Security system in a series of posts on X over the past week, calling out \"significant inconsistencies\" and saying, \"No one person actually knows how it works.\"SSA employees said that since the buyout offer targets workers nearing retirement age, the agency could suffer from losing its most experienced employees. \"The institutional expertise is invaluable,\" one employee said. \"We are overwhelmed with calls as it is.\"SSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BI on the impact slashing the workforce would have on the agency's functions.The employees said that the agency is already strained to meet the public's needs, and cutting the workforce even more could significantly harm Social Security recipients. Already, the average processing time for disability and supplemental income benefits, known as SSDI and SSI, has more than doubled since fiscal year 2016 to 231 days \u2014 just over seven and a half months.\"Drastically cutting everybody and everything has the very real potential of erasing people's record of lifetime contributions and therefore their eligibility for benefits,\" an SSA employee said. \"If they recklessly 'pulled the plug,' it would mean disaster to everyone currently collecting and future retirees and disabled claimants.\"Over 73 million Americans receive Social Security benefits \u2014 a number that will continue rising as more baby boomers retire. The agency said in its FY2024 report that staffing had declined to one of its lowest levels in over 50 years, which it attributed to years of \"chronic underfunding\" even as the number of beneficiaries increased.Phone call wait times for the agency have spiked since the fiscal year 2008, when callers would wait around four minutes to get through to the agency's 1-800 number. In fiscal year 2023, callers waited nearly 36 minutes \u2014 although SSA has made some progress in cutting down wait times. One SSA worker told BI that the areas the administration is looking to cut would directly impact customer service.\"The people who complain about long wait times and nobody answering the phone are talking about those entities,\" the worker said.One agency staffer told BI that if the Trump administration follows through with cuts, \"service to the public will undoubtedly suffer. We barely have enough staff now to meet the public's needs.\"Another employee said that for as long as they had been at the agency, it was understaffed, and a larger cut to the workforce would mean that \"overpayments to beneficiaries will drastically increase because there won't be enough workers to get to those cases in a timely manner.\" A July 2024 report by the Office of the Inspector General found that improper payments have accounted for under 1% of total SSA payouts between fiscal years 2015 and 2022. The employee said slashing the workforce could amplify the issue.\"People who can't work and are waiting on a disability decision will experience immense financial hardship,\" they said, adding that cases subject to re-evaluation \"will not be worked quickly enough to prevent overpayments and there's never a guarantee the overpayment will actually be paid.\"Kevin Foster, 64, receives over $3,000 a month. \"I feel the pain for millions of recipients who aren't as lucky as I have been,\" the Illinois resident said. \"Social Security must endure.\"Sharon Sartori, 60, who receives $967 in benefits and lives in South Carolina said, \"If checks are late, it's going to put a real strain on low-income seniors for rent, their medications, and food. Utilities could be shut off. It would be a mess.\"It's unclear how many people will voluntarily resign following the SSA's latest email to staff. The Office of Personnel Management issued a memo on February 26 requesting that all federal agencies develop reorganization plans by March 13.One staffer speculated that \"once service gets bad\" at SSA following any cuts, \"the case will be made to privatize us.\" For decades, some Republican politicians and lawmakers have floated privatizing Social Security in an effort to rein in the federal deficit, but the idea lacks mass support from voters.The SSA employees BI spoke to overwhelmingly said that the millions of Americans who rely on Social Security benefits will feel the pain from any workforce cuts.\"We need the people higher up to support us and build systems that work, we need HR. We need those 'invisible' people to make sure checks get paid on time, all the systems are up and running,\" one employee said. They added: \"I don't know why we are villains.

This unexpected alignment signals a strategic divergence from America\u2019s long-standing ties with European allies. But what led to this seemingly sudden move?\n\nA Distinct Shift in Policy\n\nFor decades, the United States has stood shoulder to shoulder with Europe, championing the cause of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty against Russian aggression. However, the recent decision to break ranks and side with Russia has sparked confusion and debate among policymakers and analysts alike. Some suggest that economic factors or broader geopolitical strategies could be influencing this realignment, while others see it as a more nuanced response to the evolving global landscape.\n\nThe European Reaction: Shock and Disbelief\n\nEuropean nations, long accustomed to a stable and predictable partnership with the U.S., are now left reassessing their own strategies and alliances. The dismay among European leaders is palpable, as they struggle to comprehend the implications of America\u2019s new stance. This unexpected turn of events raises questions about the future of transatlantic relations and the stability of the region. According to Boston University, the diplomatic channels are buzzing with efforts to bridge the growing divide and restore a sense of cohesion.\n\nRussia\u2019s Strategic Gains\n\nFrom Moscow\u2019s perspective, this newfound support from the United States is nothing short of a diplomatic coup. Russia has long sought to weaken the unified Western front that has supported Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty. With the U.S. appearing to shift its stance, Russia gains a significant advantage on the international stage, one that could embolden further diplomatic initiatives or territorial ambitions.\n\nThe Impact on Ukraine\n\nAmid these shifting allegiances, Ukraine finds itself caught in the crossfire of power politics. Ukrainian leaders, who have relied on consistent Western support, now face an uncertain future. The question of security and territorial integrity becomes increasingly pressing as Russian influence grows unchecked. Kyiv will need to navigate these precarious waters with both caution and resolve, seeking new ways to secure its interests.\n\nThe Global Perspective: A New Era of Diplomacy\n\nThis unexpected collaboration between the U.S. and Russia marks a new era in international diplomacy. While some view it as a pragmatic move to reduce tensions, others fear it could destabilize the region further. As stated in Boston University, the world watches with bated breath to see how this decision will unfold and what it ultimately means for global peace efforts.\n\nIn conclusion, the ramifications of the United States\u2019 decision to align with Russia are profound, affecting not only the immediate conflict in Ukraine but also the broader dynamics of international relations.

It was established by former President Joe Biden in 2023 and intended to give student-loan borrowers cheaper monthly payments with a shorter timeline for loan forgiveness.Under the SAVE plan, Stephens owed $0 monthly based on her income level. If SAVE goes away, she said she cannot afford higher payments while also financially supporting her two children.\"If we didn't have our family support helping us with the kids and food and stuff like that, we would not be making it every month,\" Stephens said. \"We'd be losing our house and everything, so we can't even imagine to start paying on those loans yet.\"BI heard from dozens of student-loan borrowers over the past few weeks who said they're worried about the SAVE plan being eliminated and are concerned with facing potentially higher monthly payments. While the legal fate of the plan is still in limbo, borrowers are stuck wondering when they'll have to resume repayment \u2014 and how much the bill will be.Due to the legal challenges seeking to block the plan, January guidance from the Education Department said that borrowers enrolled in SAVE will make payments \"no earlier\" than December. Interest is not accruing on their balances during this time.After the recent court decision keeping SAVE paused, acting undersecretary of education, James Bergeron, told BI in a statement that the ruling \"is good news for hardworking American taxpayers and the rule of law.\"\"The Department of Education is currently working to ensure borrowers understand existing repayment alternatives allowed under the law,\" Bergeron said.Stephens said she doesn't see it that way \u2014 and hopes the Trump administration prioritizes relief for student-loan borrowers.\"I think that it helped a lot of people,\" she said, referring to the SAVE plan, \"and it's really heartbreaking that it just ended with nothing.\"Mike Rendino, 51, accrued student debt in his 30s when he went back to school to advance his career. When his job relocated and he couldn't move, he found himself out of work and deferred his loans. But interest continued to accumulate during those few years.Enrolling in SAVE allowed Rendino to pay $160 each month \u2014 which he felt was affordable. Now, however, he no longer feels confident with his payoff plan, which he said is projected to be just under $1,000 a month without SAVE.\"It's going to be very scary to figure this out,\" Rendino said.\"This program is literally allowing me to fulfill my financial obligations back to the government for those federal loans,\" he said, adding that \"it's not that I don't want to repay it, it's that I just cannot afford to pay the kind of money that they want.\"Brigitte Knudson, 56, is also struggling with SAVE's uncertain fate. While Knudson said she's still been making payments during this time to take advantage of the 0% interest rate, she's prepared to push off her retirement to afford potentially higher monthly payments.\"Every extra dollar that I get is going to pay down this loan because I know there's going to be no forgiveness,\" Knudson said. \"Just tell me what the bottom line is, and I can plan for that.\"If a court ends up permanently striking down the SAVE plan, it's unlikely the Trump administration will create something similar to replace it. That's because Republicans have argued that SAVE is an overreach of the education secretary's authority by allowing for expanded opportunities for relief.Rather, some Republican lawmakers have introduced legislation to streamline income-driven repayment plans. GOP control over both Congress and the White House could ease that legislation into passage.A memo compiled by House Republicans in January suggested repealing SAVE and proposed other measures like expanding the Pell Grant for low-income students and providing more options for borrowers who default on their loans.The College Cost Reduction Act, introduced by Rep. Virginia Foxx, proposed capping certain forms of financial aid and limiting the education secretary's ability to implement new repayment and relief plans, like SAVE, in the future.Some borrowers enrolled in SAVE, though, are concerned those alternatives would not be sufficient. Rendino, an independent voter who said he previously supported some Republican policies, said the way the GOP has approached student-loan issues may be enough to turn him away from the party altogether \u2014 especially if SAVE ultimately gets struck down.\"This is crucial to be able to have affordable payments like this for the foreseeable future,\" Rendinso said. \"It's the only way a lot of us are going to survive and be able to keep the economy going.\"Do you have a story to share about student loans?

Yet the Government Accountability Office assessed last year that the F-35 isn't hitting mission-capable rates and hasn't for years. These are key criticisms the fighter has faced.A Lockheed representative said that addressing these issues comes down to reliably investing in parts and maintenance. Edward Smith, the company's F-35 business development director, said that \"to maintain a fleet at any given readiness level, you have to fully fund your supply system.\"The Joint Program Office previously told BI that readiness tends to improve with a healthy supply of parts for maintenance.Smith said that the F-35 has historically been underfunded in terms of the supply purchased for the aircraft and depot repair capacity, adding that it's important to get the supply of sustainment parts at a level that matches the jet's readiness needs.\"If the parts are available and on the shelf,\" he said, then \"we can get to the readiness rates that are desired by all of our customers that are out there.\"And for overall costs, he said that as more F-35s roll off the production line and the supply pool of parts grows, the aircraft will become increasingly cheaper to operate. Over the last decade, explained Smith, it has seen a 50% reduction in cost-per-flight-hour, in some cases making it as expensive to fly as fourth-generation jets being made today but delivering more capability.Smith said that the average mission capability rates for the F-35, which is the percentage of time it can perform one mission, tend to be between the high 50s and high 60s.This figures are higher on combat deployments; the US military averages an 80% mission capability rate for the F-35 on every combat deployment it's done, and for the Israelis, since the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks, the number is almost 90%, he said.\"It exactly matches our funding level for parts. Traditionally, we've been funded at about 70% availability, and that's if nothing broke,\" Smith said. \"If you don't fund supply, you cannot have the readiness,\" he added.The F-35 is the US military's second fifth-generation fighter jet after the air-superiority F-22 Raptor. The jet comes in three variants designed for conventional runway and ship-based operations and is flown by the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy.The US military has flown all three F-35 variants \u2014 the A, B, and C variants \u2014 in strike missions against terror groups in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen.The Israel Defense Forces were the first to fly the jet into battle. They operate their own version (the F-35I) and have flown it into combat, battling Syrian missile batteries, shooting down drones, and striking Iranian military sites.The jets, however, were built for a higher level of warfare, which would demand the advantages offered by its all-aspect stealth, sensor suite, networked systems, and combat power, all capabilities required for combating next-gen aircraft and high-end surface-to-air threats.The F-35 was developed and manufactured as part of a multinational partnership, and over 1,110 jets have been delivered. Many US allies operate the aircraft, with more countries looking to acquire this plane in the future. It's considered a cornerstone for US airpower.The F-35 program relies on a shared contractor and government-based maintenance system. How contracts are issued may affect how readiness issues are fixed. To increase efficiency, \"we need to drive to more performance-based sustainment contracts,\" Smith said.He said sustainment for the F-35 is contracted on an annual basis. He called this process inefficient and \"very costly,\" arguing that it doesn't allow the industry to plan and invest strategically because it's uncertain what the next annual contract could look like.\"There's definitely room to increase efficiency in how we contract for these systems and put the onus on industry to perform,\" he said.\"That's what we continue to strive for is those performance-based contracts that we not only get as a prime, but also with our suppliers,\" Smith said, noting this gives them \"long-term certainty and forecasting so we can invest to improve the metrics for this airplane.\"Performance-based contracting is centered on the results achieved from a specific program in terms of requirements rather than the cost or time needed to ultimately achieve them.Michael Bohnert, a licensed engineer at the RAND Corporation, said that longer-term contracts tend to be more efficient than annual contracts for long-term acquisition because they provide the industry an opportunity to plan.Performance-based contracts \"can be an effective tool,\" he told BI, \"but they require a deeper understanding of the systems to set adequate performance goals with accurate pricing.\"The F-35 JPO, which leads the aircraft's life-cycle program management, acknowledged that annualized sustainment contracts are not ideal for reducing costs and improving readiness. However, it said bad performance contracts can arguably be worse.\"Key considerations for performance contracts include funding stability for sustainment, confidence in data for forecasting and cost modeling, and contract structures that balance risk between industry and government,\" a JPO spokesperson told BI.\"Performance contracts must align with warfighter needs, potentially requiring a mix of contracting strategies,\" the office said.A Lockheed Martin spokesperson told BI that the company is committed to working with the JPO \"on delivering mission-essential and effective sustainment support for the F-35 program now and in the future.\"The spokesperson said pursuing a performance-based contracting strategy is a decision made by the Pentagon. \"I would defer you to them for further comment. We support any model that can increase readiness and reduce cost for our customer,\" they said.", "summary": "The supersonic aircraft is widely recognized as a top fifth-generation fighter jet, but the program has faced criticisms.", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/what-f-35-jet-makers-need-tackle-cost-readiness-concerns-2025-2", "image": "https://i.insider.com/67c2213669253ccddf97f659?width=1200&format=jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 09:30:02", "author": "Jake Epstein", "authors": ["Jake Epstein"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.402}, {"id": 295590808, "title": "I took the $360 Caledonian Sleeper train to Scotland.

But the gray area of being neither fully together nor actually broken up can invite all sorts of complications\u2014confusion, jealousy and messy misunderstandings that end up adding unnecessary drama to the mix.\nThere\u2019s no shortage of pop culture references showcasing how badly an unceremonious pause can go (Ross and Rachel). But according to Kongit Farrell, LMFT, AASECT-certified sex therapist and founder of the Inspired Journey Counseling Center in Los Angeles, a relationship break, when done right, can actually offer a few real benefits. For one, \u201cstepping away can give some people distance and the opportunity to gain clarity about the relationship\u2019s value and direction,\u201d says Farrell\u2014like when you\u2019re running into circular arguments or familiar hiccups that leave you questioning its long-term potential. Also, softly exploring what it\u2019s like to not be together (without fully calling it quits) can be just what you need to assess whether a permanent separation feels right.\n\u201cIt can also be a chance to reconnect with your personal identity and individual priorities that may have taken a backseat in the relationship,\u201d Farrell adds. Whether it\u2019s boosting your self-esteem without relying on your SO for validation or finally getting back into the solo travelling that you couldn\u2019t do because of your partner\u2019s hectic schedule, time apart can help you better understand who you are\u2014and what you want, both in love and in life.\nThat said, it\u2019s important to know that \u201ca break itself is not some magic fix,\u201d says Liz Higgins, LMFT, licensed therapist and founder of Millennial Life Counseling in Dallas. In other words, not talking to each other for a bit won\u2019t suddenly resolve deeper problems like poor communication, jealousy or trust issues. \u201cThe benefits you\u2019ll reap depend on the work you do while you\u2019re apart,\u201d Higgins explains.\nSo the real trick to making a temporary reset meaningful and not just a stepping stone to a real breakup? Knowing how to do it. Below, we\u2019ve outlined a few expert tips to help you get it right.\n1. Maybe don\u2019t call it a \u201cbreak\u201d at all\nThe word break tends to carry a lot of baggage, often coming across as a polite way of delaying the inevitable. That\u2019s why, if you\u2019re considering one with your partner, it might be more constructive (and less daunting) to reframe it as \u201ctaking space\u201d instead.\nThe difference may seem subtle, but according to Higgins, it\u2019s pretty powerful. \u201cThe language you use matters in helping you approach the situation with more clarity,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd taking a break in a relationship can imply something is fundamentally broken or disjointed, which might make it feel more final and negative than it actually is.\u201d Space, on the other hand, sounds a lot more neutral: It signals that you\u2019re intentionally giving each other room to breathe and reflect\u2014something that even the healthiest of couples need occasionally.\n2. Consider the goals of your temporary reset early on\nBasically, why do you even want to take a break in the first place? Are you trying to figure out if you can forgive your SO for emotionally cheating? Do you need space to work through personal challenges, like deep-seated insecurities or an unhealthy relationship with alcohol, without the added responsibilities of a partnership? Or maybe you\u2019ve both been feeling disconnected lately, so you\u2019re hoping that a little time apart will help you reconnect\u2014or confirm you\u2019re better off going your separate ways.\nBeing clear about your goals from the start can give your break more direction, structure and purpose beyond delaying a breakup, Higgins says. Without that intention, you might end up spending the whole time\u2026waiting for the other person to text you back.\n3. Decide how long the break will last up-front\nAccording to Farrell, there isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all answer for how long a relationship break should be. For some a few days are enough to gain perspective, while others may need weeks or even months. What\u2019s important is having an end date. \u201cOtherwise, the break may extend indefinitely, which is more indicative of avoidance rather than a genuine attempt to strengthen or reevaluate the relationship,\u201d Farrell says.\nThe good news is, you\u2019re free to adjust the timeline of your temporary separation if needed\u2014simply chat with your partner ahead of time about how you\u2019ll touch base about potential changes. On that note\u2026.\n4. Establish a few ground rules before you hit pause\nAre you going to stay exclusive or hook up with other people? Will you check in occasionally or maintain radio silence for the entire month? Too often someone impulsively declares a break without addressing the details, which \u201cresults in confusion, misunderstandings, resentment and hurt feelings,\u201d Farrell explains. That\u2019s why both therapists suggest establishing clear expectations beforehand to avoid messy, dramatic surprises down the line.\nThe parameters will depend on you and your SO. For example, couples looking to strengthen their communication skills might agree on weekly 10-minute calls just to see if the break needs to be extended or shortened\u2014no small talk or life updates. While for others struggling with codependency, a strict \u201cno contact\u201d rule throughout the hiatus may be needed to grow independently.\n5. Make the most out of your time apart\nIn other words, don\u2019t just fill the void with distractions like mindlessly swiping through dating apps, overloading your schedule to avoid being alone or sneakily texting your partner \u201cIMY\u201d late at night. These habits might soothe the initial discomfort of being without your special someone, but they also prevent you from sitting with your feelings and reflecting on what you really need.\nInstead, remember the goal you had in mind\u2014and brainstorm some steps to help achieve it. Journaling about the highs and lows of your dynamic could be a great way to step back and ID any recurring patterns (like arguments that keep circling the same issues). You could also use this time to engage in activities that boost your confidence\u2014join a Pilates class you\u2019ve been itching to try or rekindle those friendships that you neglected during your codependent moments. Basically, the more you use this space to reconnect with your needs, goals and values, the better positioned you\u2019ll be to decide what comes next.\n6. Ease back into your reunion with honesty\nOnce the break is over, it\u2019s time to reflect on what you\u2019ve learned and how you\u2019re feeling now\u2014and be open about these breakthroughs with your partner. Maybe you handled the fallout of a recent personal tragedy and now you\u2019re ready to process everything together. Or perhaps your long-term goals are clearer, and you\u2019re realising they may no longer align with your SO\u2019s. Whatever the case, discussing these insights post-break is essential to make sure you\u2019re on the same page about moving forward rather than assuming what each of you wants.\nFrom there, it\u2019s about deciding what comes next. This temporary reset might reveal the unfortunate but very real possibility that parting ways for good is the healthiest option. A little distance made it clear that, no, you can\u2019t overlook cheating, for instance, or that being with someone who wants to start a family is a non-negotiable you can\u2019t compromise on.\nOn the flip side, maybe time apart really did make the heart grow fonder and you\u2019re ready to try again. If that\u2019s the case, Higgins says it\u2019s important to maintain honest, transparent communication rather than pretending nothing happened. So don\u2019t shy away from voicing any lingering doubts that require extra reassurance or setting new expectations moving forward (more physical affection, less passive-aggressiveness). That way, your break serves its purpose\u2014helping you gain clarity rather than leaving you in a haze of uncertainty and awkward tension.\nThis article first appeared on self.com\n\nWhat to know about stonewalling, the silent relationship killer\nHow to trust your partner again after they\u2019ve lied to you\nThe best relationship advice I\u2019ve received?

Pisces, you emerge triumphant after walking a long winding road to your destination. Finding order in chaos and taking the time to listen to that soft little voice in your head is all you need to keep moving forward, Virgo. Transition is never undemanding, Sagittarius, but it doesn\u2019t need to bleed you dry either. Remember that there is underlying order even in chaos, and you, Libra, are the master who decodes it effortlessly. Scroll on to read your March horoscope:\n\nCultivating patience may be your key to lasting happiness. What you are supposed to do with your hidden blessings will be revealed in time. For now, this is your season, so ensure you reap your golden harvest while also keeping the soils of your mind and heart fertile. For those seeking love and relationships, you are being supported immensely. This is the end of an inverted time capsule and you will soon emerge on the other side renewed, refreshed and supported.\n\nA cluttered mind and surroundings only lead to a scrambled life. Focus on your health and healing, jot down your goals as well as your deepest feelings and pay attention to the insights and inspirations that strike you. But more importantly, remember to be gentle with yourself through it all. Often when we receive our manifestations, we immerse ourselves so fully in them that we end up burning out in order to feel worthy of keeping them. But the trick here is to treat them like your new normal while still being rooted in gratitude to keep the spell from being jinxed.\n\nYour passion and purpose may have led you to move in ways that pushed you beyond your comfort zone, so here you are, writing history. From the moment something caught your fancy, you knew it was for you. Now is not the time to back down or dim your grand plans and visions. Speak up, stand tall and let yourself be seen. Work relentlessly towards your goals because nothing goes unnoticed in the eyes of the universe. Let your fervour be the glue that binds your faith with your dreams and it will make everything easily surmountable.\n\nIt\u2019s a time to reassess your finances, schedules, wardrobe and every other thing that engages with your life in the tiniest of ways. The trademark of a healthy lifestyle is balance. Ensure you get your 10 hours of sleep to support those big goals during the day, consume your greens before you devour that slice of cake and go for a five-minute walk for every hour you sit in front of a screen. Breaking down your big goals into bite-sized steps that you can tackle will go a long way while also keeping you energised to take on the world.\n\nSometimes, what is needed is not courage but compassion. This is one of those pivotal points in your life where clearly seeing through a situation and choosing to hold space within your heart reveals all the goodness that is ready to overflow. Drop your guard, get out, seek like-minded folks and connect with nature to ground and regenerate your body, mind and soul. Every warrior needs some downtime, so do you. Rest and relieve your stress and anxiety to get your creative juices flowing again.\n\nYou never shy away from arduous labour\u2014almost to the point of forgetting to care for yourself. A really rushed time calls for additional self-care, drizzled with some frequent deep belly breaths to clear your mind and restore your energy, allowing you to take flight once again. Finding order in chaos and taking the time to listen to that soft little voice in your head is all you need to keep moving forward. Your wellness is your greatest treasure, so be mindful of not short-changing yourself for those fake glittering coins.\n\nAs wobbly as these times may feel, you know that ultimately it all works out just fine. Organise your thoughts, plans and ideas by putting pen to paper and taking stock of your life. Strike off anything that feels off, burdensome or misaligned. Treat yourself like royalty waiting to be crowned. See past the illusions and bend them to your liking to bring your visions to life. Remember that there is underlying order even in chaos, and you are the master who decodes it effortlessly.\n\nDisplaced emotions are better corrected, even if in hindsight. Your angels want to remind you that your goals for prosperity and empowerment are very plausible, even if you choose not to grind your way through life. Set clear intentions, chart out a rough plan of action and charge ahead with the assurance that your magical unicorns have your back. Consume life as one warm, gooey chocolate cake, immersing yourself in the cosiness of each moment.\nSagittarius\nWhile you may be going through some major changes, specifically professionally for some people, your angels want you to remember that you can choose to move through these times with ease and flow. So take your time to pick your track in the race of life. Transition is never undemanding, but it doesn\u2019t need to bleed you dry either. Simply ask the universe for signs and support. Clear your mind and expect magic to unfurl. Your loved ones from across the veil are sending you love and blessings, so claim them. And of course, follow the crumbs the cosmos throws your way.\n\nCrown yourself for deciding to take charge of your life. Your relationships, however friction-based, are getting a makeover and beginning to glow. Disagreements are either being resolved or nullified and fairness from the cosmos is being served with love. Your job here is to remember that while you love holding space for others, sometimes you must also stand up for yourself. A part of expanding spiritually is also learning to say no, walking away from drama and choosing your inner peace over all else. You are ready for this.\n\nToo much work and too little play are making you dull. Wake up from this mindless slumber and re-evaluate the ways in which you can build your castles while still resting in them. Peace and ease are the cornerstones to what you bring forward in life, but you must find them within you before you spread yourself too thin, almost to the point of breaking. Focus on your highest priorities to get your life organised. Create room for expansion by swimming in cosmic expansiveness.\n\nYou emerge triumphant after walking a long winding road to your destination. A shift in your career, your purpose and perhaps even your roles is likely to usher in more fulfilment and enriching experiences your way. If you can\u2019t listen to the voice of the cosmos just yet, pause, breathe and remember to allow your life to unfold in \u2018kairos\u2019 time\u2014where you are never late and the universe brings you everything just in the perfect moment. Celebrate with your core team, nurture yourself and your loved ones and allow yourself to be held in the endearing embrace of the cosmos.\n\nIt\u2019s time to start embracing our flop eras\nI tried the 80/20 home cleaning tip and it made my space tidy quicker than you\u2019d think\nHow to build your self-confidence so you can have the life you deserve", "summary": "Earth, water, air and fire\u2014we\u2019ve covered all elements for your monthly predictions", "url": "https://www.vogue.in/content/your-march-2025-horoscope-is-here-see-where-the-stars-are-guiding-you", "image": "https://assets.vogue.in/photos/67c1c65e964a9f798fa9d1cc/16:9/w_1072,h_603,c_limit/March%20horoscope.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 04:59:37", "author": "Snehaa Khanna Sahgal", "authors": ["Snehaa Khanna Sahgal"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.52}, {"id": 295553548, "title": "20 best eyeliner shades for every eye colour", "text": "There\u2019s nothing like a stroke of liner in a fun colour for an unexpected beauty moment\u2014and the best eyeliner shades are an easy way to achieve that. But where do you begin with a rainbow spectrum of shades to choose from? While there are no hard-and-fast rules for makeup, referencing the colour wheel is always a good place to start (and perhaps a nostalgic reminder of grade school art class). \u201cContrasting your eyeliner to enhance your eye colour is an easy trick to bring attention to your eyes,\u201d says Los Angeles-based makeup artist Beau Nelson. Long story short, a complimentary colour creates a strong visual impact.\nOnce you\u2019ve determined the colour you want, it\u2019s time to choose your actual liner. Professional makeup artist Anastasia Vavina recommends a pencil over a liquid liner when getting playful. \u201cPencils allow for more application control than liquid eyeliners. You can stay precise or easily achieve a smoked-out look,\u201d Vavina explains, adding that mistakes can also be easily blended and buffed with creamy pencil formulas. Since we\u2019re not the colour theory masters, we tapped four pros to share their tips and tricks for playing up eye colour\u2014and which of the best eyeliner shades to choose to make your gaze pop.\nThe best eyeliner shades for brown eyes\n\u201cBrown eyes are already neutral, so you can really play with colour on brown eyes,\u201d explains Katie Jane Hughes, who gravitates toward jewel-toned eyeliners for brown-eyed clients (and regularly reaches for Glossier's eyeliner pencil in the shade Rococo). When in doubt Hughes says to think rich berry tones, deep purples, and emerald greens. For a more subtle approach, consider makeup artist Tasha Reiko Brown\u2019s go-to eye-brightening strategy: A gold eyeliner dabbed on the inner corners. \u201cIt catches the warm light of brown eyes [for extra sparkle],\u201d she says.\n\nThe best eyeliner shades for blue eyes\nThinking back to the trust colour wheel, Nelson reminds us that the contrasting colour to blue is yellow. Rather than taking that as a literal interpretation, he leans towards more flaxen colours. \u201cGolden browns, bronzes, and coppers all set blue eyes off nicely,\u201d he says. Hughes agrees and leans towards warm hues like rusty orange to make all variations of ocean eyes (as Billie Eilish might say) truly stand out.\n\nThe best eyeliner shades for hazel eyes\nWith tones of green, gold, and brown, hazel eyes are inherently dimensional\u2014and there are many different approaches one can take with eyeliners to emphasize their multifaceted irises. \u201cPurples, pinks, burgundies, and cranberries bring out the green tones in hazel eyes,\u201d says Nelson. For Hughes, a rich teal supplies a cool contrast, while for Brown, taking a tone-on-tone approach with an emerald green \u201creally makes the colours [of Hazel eyes] jump.\u201d\n\nThe best eyeliner shades for green eyes\nIt's all about burgundy for green eyes (think: the colour of a glass of red wine). No eyeliner shade can compare to the crimson colour juxtaposed to verdant toned eyes, according Brown. \u201cBright burgundy\u2026moody burgundy\u2026brown burgundies\u2026 all are colour wheel opposites meaning shades of green and red always complement each other,\u201d she explains. \u201cA rich burgundy brings an unexpected pop of colour that\u2019s bold, but wearable.\u201d\n\nThe best eyeliner shades for Grey eyes\nIt\u2019s true: Less than 3% of the global population has gray eyes, which can be mistaken for blue, but most often appear dark gray, grayish blue, or grayish green. For this rare shade, Nelson recommends royal blues and blue-toned violet shades to bring out their different aspects. Alternatively, \u201cdeep, beautiful reds will bring high contrast and make the eyes pop,\u201d says Hughes.\n\nHow to choose the best eyeliner shades\nOther than classic black and brown eyeliners, there\u2019s a vast breadth of shades to consider to make your eyes pop. Say you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed with picking the right eyeliner shade according to the colour wheel, or perhaps you\u2019re a bit cautious when getting playful with your makeup\u2014professional MUA Anastasia Vavina suggests focusing more on the finish, as metallics and shimmer are popular current beauty trends. \u201cI tend to add more satin or metallic shades of eyeliners for my models and clients to add an instant refreshing effect\u2014this adds an extra bounce of light to your evening makeup look, giving you a sophisticated, sultry eye,\u201d she explains. When in doubt, Vavina notes that burgundy and rich reds look fabulous on all eye colours\u2014and you don\u2019t need much. \u201cI love to add burgundy on my client\u2019s waterline, smudging it a bit, to give a subtle classic smoky eye feel without even using any eyeshadows,\u201d says Vavina.\nThis article first appeared on vogue.com\n\nThe best eyeshadow sticks to simplify any makeup look\n10 celebrity-approved makeup techniques to highlight your brown eyes\nDeepika Padukone's makeup artist reveals how to master the classic eyeliner look\nThe real story behind the cat-eye flick, the world\u2019s oldest makeup trick\nAll products are independently selected by our editors.

and the third victim was an elderly woman, later identified as Desir.\n\nA local ABC station in Raleigh reported that authorities said Darbouze greeted police at the door with blood on his hands, face and pants.\n\nAt the time of the stabbing, authorities added, there were three other children inside the home.\n\nAuthorities also said that surveillance footage allegedly shows Darbouze walking around with a knife, and during a preliminary investigation, investigators located a knife with blood on it in his room.\n\nDarbouze was arrested at the scene and is currently being held at the

But once in, McCready found the piece of evidence that would help her secure a measure of justice for her daughter: a superior's letter of apology.\n\nBattery Sgt Maj Michael Webber \u2013 who was 20 years older than Beck, five ranks above her and married \u2013 had allegedly pinned the teenager down at a drink-fuelled event during a training course, and tried to kiss her. The letter, in which he admitted to \"absolutely unacceptable\" behaviour, provided a vital piece of evidence, which was shared at Beck's inquest, to back up her family's belief that she had been sexually assaulted, and that the Army had covered it up.\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

Yet when she reported Webber's actions, they were deemed merely \"inappropriate contact\" and he was let off with a minor sanction. So when Beck's line manager, Bombardier Ryan Mason, became fixated on her a few months later, sending her more than 4,600 messages in two months, Beck did not raise it, for fear of being branded a trouble-maker. At her inquest last week, the coroner found that, though there were other factors (including the breakup of a relationship), the mishandling of her complaint and Mason's harassment had contributed to her death.\n\nThe MoD claims that the Army has already changed, said Isabel Hardman in The i Paper. But during the inquest, more than 1,000 women wrote online about their experience of being sexually harassed and assaulted in the Army \u2013 many referencing recent incidents. If the MoD is serious about ending a toxic culture, it should start by insisting that allegations of harassment and assault are investigated by an independent body \u2013 not military officials whose instinct may be to play down incidents and give their accused comrades the benefit of the doubt.\n\nThe Army wants women to serve, said The Times, and at this \"time of peril\", it badly needs to boost its recruitment and retention rates. Women who join up must accept the possibility of coming under attack from the enemy.

Now, crypto investors are eyeing new opportunities like PropiChain, which offers real-world utility in real estate.\n\nIf you had $500 to invest today, would Dogecoin\u2019s unpredictable swings or PropiChain\u2019s blockchain-powered real estate model be the smarter bet to deliver $550K? \n\nWith PropiChain still at $0.011, the upside is massive. Let\u2019s compare these altcoins and see which one is the best bet for turning $500 into $550k in 2025.\n\nDogecoin\u2019s Market Trend: Can This Crypto Meet Investor Expectations?\n\nFrom 2020 to 2021, Dogecoin saw an explosive price surge, turning early adopters into crypto millionaires. On May 8, 2021, it reached an all-time high of $0.7316.\n\nFollowing the U.S. election, Dogecoin experienced a strong uptrend, gaining over 130% in just 30 days. However, after the rally, Dogecoin faced a slight pullback before stabilizing.\n\nDespite this, Dogecoin remains over 40% below its peak. Investors are hopeful for another breakout, but its high market cap and supply could limit the chances of repeating its 2021 surge.\n\nFrom $500 to $550K: How PropiChain is Shaping the Crypto Market\n\nPropiChain is revolutionizing real estate investment by combining blockchain technology with property ownership. At its core is real estate tokenization, allowing investors to own fractional shares of properties through digital tokens.\n\nTraditional real estate requires high capital and complex legal steps, but PropiChain eliminates these barriers. Its AI-driven analytics provide data-backed insights, enabling smarter investment decisions based on market trends and property performance.\n\nThis isn\u2019t speculation; it\u2019s a real-world application that makes property investment faster and more efficient, placing PropiChain ahead of Dogecoin for wealth creation.\n\nPropiChain\u2019s integration with the metaverse enhances real estate investing. Investors can explore virtual property replicas before making decisions, merging digital assets with real-world value.\n\nSmart contracts further improve security and transparency by automating leases, payments, and agreements, ensuring transactions are recorded on the blockchain permanently.\n\nWith its CoinMarketCap listing and rising recognition, PropiChain is emerging as a strong competitor to established cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin. Investors seeking the next major crypto opportunity are watching its potential to reshape real estate investment.\n\nWhy PropiChain is Drawing Investor Attention\n\nThe crypto market is evolving as investors shift focus toward utility-driven assets. While Dogecoin remains a popular name, its potential for massive growth is limited due to its market saturation.\n\nMeanwhile, PropiChain is emerging as a strong contender, positioning itself as the top crypto to turn your $500 into $550k. By integrating blockchain with real estate investments, it offers tangible value and attracts forward-thinking investors seeking exponential returns.\n\nAs the industry prioritizes real-world applications, PropiChain stands out by transforming property ownership through blockchain technology. Its approach signals a shift from speculative trading to practical financial solutions.\n\nPropiChain\u2019s rise isn\u2019t fueled by hype alone. A successful audit by BlockAudit, a blockchain security firm, reinforces its credibility, making it a secure option for investors seeking long-term gains.\n\nWhy PropiChain\u2019s Presale Is Taking the Lead\n\nPropiChain\u2019s second presale phase is underway, with tokens available at $0.011. Analysts predict a post-launch price surge to $1, offering early investors a major opportunity for exponential gains.\n\nA $1,000 investment at this stage would secure 90,909 tokens. If PropiChain hits $1, that investment will turn into $90,909, delivering a massive 90x return. Therefore, Propichain would likely turn your $500 investment into $550k in 2025.\n\nWhile Dogecoin remains a well-known crypto asset, its growth is slower due to market saturation. Investors looking for rapid returns may find PropiChain a stronger contender in the race to become a crypto millionaire.\n\nWith each presale phase bringing a price increase, early adopters stand to benefit the most. Over 60% of this phase is already completed, with more than $1.2 million raised. PropiChain is positioning itself as the top crypto to watch for in 2025. \n\nDon\u2019t miss out on this opportunity.\n\nFor more information about PropiChain Presale", "summary": "Dogecoin started as a meme but turned early investors into millionaires through hype and celebrity support.

Its groundbreaking innovation allowed investors to troop in, changing the course of digital finance forever.\n\nHowever, some Ethereum Whales have identified RCO Finance (RCOF), a fresh crypto venture with amazing potential. With several amazing features, analysts are backing this crypto asset to mirror Ethereum\u2019s 2021 rally.\n\nCan Ethereum Still Reward Investors in 2025?\n\nThe crypto market is in recovery mode after losing almost 7% in value. Now, Ethereum has rebounded to a price of $2,486, a move that has caused renewed interest in the asset. However, the high entry point for Ethereum makes it inaccessible to many. \n\nEven the best analysts are predicting a move to the $3,500 mark. And for investors looking to take advantage of the incoming bull run, this profit margin is too little to make substantial profits. This is why attention has switched to this low value altcoin with incredible potential.\n\nRCOF is introducing utility, which will ensure price stability even after the bull run. This proposition has caused excitement in the crypto world, and as at the time of writing, RCOF has over 10,000 users currently on its platform. With the token set to list for $0.6, there\u2019s no better time to secure positions, and ETH whales know this.\n\nRCO Finance: The Platform Everyone Is Talking About \n\nRCO Finance is introducing the Robo Advisor, a man-made intelligence platform that makes personalized investment suggestions backed by valuable data. By applying this analysis, investors gain an edge in the market by spotting high-potential assets ahead of time.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Ethereum\u2019s incredible 2021 rally. In 2021, ETH moved from around $730 to nearly $4,900. Early investors reaped massive profits as institutional adoption and DeFi growth increased the demand. But there was a catch.\n\nHundreds of investors missed the entirety of the bull run, while some entered too late or didn\u2019t close trades. And as a result, they lost their profits when the market consolidated. If RCO Finance\u2019s Robo Advisor existed at the time, it would have identified early shifts in the momentum of Ethereum, positioning investors ahead of when the rally began. \n\nMost importantly, it would have warned investors when to rebalance their portfolios, locking in gains before the inevitable price corrections erased billions of dollars in value. The Robo Advisor takes its data from platforms like Reuters and Bloomberg, giving investors accurate and real-time advice. With the Alpha platform set to be released soon, the Robo Advisor will become even more powerful.\n\nIn addition to crypto, RCO Finance gives users access to over 120,000 assets across 12,500 categories, including tokenized property, stocks, and digital assets. This diversity gives investors a chance to build diversified portfolios to better manage risks.\n\nIn contrast to exchanges that require invasive identity verification, RCO Finance offers a KYC-free experience. Investors can trade and invest anonymously, eliminating any form of delay.\n\nHaving RCOF tokens brings significant advantages, including a staking system that has high yield and generates passive income. In addition, token holders get premium access to the Robo Advisor and other features.\n\nThe beta platform has also been launched, and RCOF token holders can now interact with some of its revolutionary AI features. However, the platform will receive regular upgrades for better user experiences.\n\nTime is Running Out-Join the RCOF Token Presale Today\n\nOne RCOF token is currently priced at $0.1, one of the lowest prices this token will ever trade for. In just a few weeks, the token will sell for $0.13, meaning you\u2019ll need more funds to buy the same amount you can get today.\n\nA $1,000 investment today will allow you to acquire 10,000 tokens, and by the end of the presale, these tokens could be worth $40,000 or more. And by the time the incoming bull run takes effect, your profits could run into the millions.\n\nThe platform has also undergone a comprehensive audit by SolidProof, and RCOF\u2019s smart contract and infrastructure were confirmed to have no vulnerabilities. So investors can purchase tokens with confidence.\n\nThe presale is almost over, signalling the end of the opportunity to buy RCOF tokens at the lowest price possible before they are available in the open market. Investors who act now can secure their positions before prices surge.\n\nFor more information about the RCO Finance Presale", "summary": "Ethereum transformed the entire crypto market when it introduced its smart contracts, opening its gates to DeFi, tokenization, and blockchain &#8230; Continue reading\n\n\nThe post Ethereum Whales Shift Capital into This Hidden Crypto Ahead of a Major Rally appeared first on Finbold.", "url": "https://finbold.com/ethereum-whales-shift-capital-into-this-hidden-crypto-ahead-of-a-major-rally/", "image": "https://assets.finbold.com/uploads/2025/02/wagr665.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 03:00:00", "author": "Goh Marketing", "authors": ["Goh Marketing"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.008}, {"id": 295510304, "title": "Why RCO Finance is Dominating the Best Crypto Presale Rankings in 2025", "text": "Industry experts consider the RCO Finance (RCOF) crypto presale the best crypto presale of 2025, as it raised nearly $14 million in funding in just three months.

One among them is Sir Ganga Ram, a civil engineer and philanthropist, whose imprint can be found in Pakistan's Lahore as well as in Delhi.While many people know about the famous Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi, a similar hospital is there in Lahore. The hospital in Lahore was built by Sir Ganga Ram in 1921 \u2013 30 years before the one in Delhi was constructed in his honour. The Sir Ganga Ram hospital in Lahore continues to attract hundreds of patients daily. Recently, his residence, which was in ruins and relegated to the annals of history, was renovated by a businessman and an architect. The renovation of the Ganga Ram Haveli was completed in June 2024.Interestingly, despite the piece of heritage being situated in the heart of Lahore in Gulberg, few had an inkling of its historical importance, said Faraz Zaidi, who led the haveli's restoration project. \"Nobody knew this place existed in the heart of Lahore. One day I got a call from Parul Dutta, who is the great-granddaughter of Sri Ganga Ram, and she thanked me, saying she had been looking for this house for 20 years. She and some of her relatives came to Lahore and stayed with us for 5 days. It is lovely to see people appreciating what we have done here on the other side of the border,\" Zaidi told India Today.Born in 1851 in Mangtanwala village in Lahore, Ganga Ram completed his studies from Thomason Engineering College in Roorkee (now in Uttarakhand). It was under him that Lahore witnessed an architectural revolution.He is credited with designing and constructing several iconic buildings, like the Lahore Museum, the Aitchison College, the General Post Office etc. He also constructed Model Town, one of the poshest localities in Lahore.Sir Ganga Ram passed away in 1927 in London. During the 1947 Partition, his family moved to Delhi.However, his legacy remained intertwined with the city of Lahore. His contributions were well documented by writer Sadat Hasan Manto in his story, The Garland.In the story, Manto narrates a true incident during the Partition. Amid heightened tensions, a mob attempted to vandalise Sir Ganga Ram's statue in front of his hospital in Lahore. However, one of them gets injured during the incident and had to be rushed to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital for treatment.Published By: Abhishek DePublished On: Mar 1, 2025Must Watch", "summary": "How legacy of Sir Ganga Ram, father of modern Lahore, lives on in Pakistan", "url": "https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/sir-ganga-ram-legacy-hospital-lahore-pakistan-house-renovation-2687455-2025-03-01", "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202503/ganga-ram-hospital-011744991-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=wxLNtWGSU_ykdKDwCjqpeNiU3MyxQSKL?size=1280:720", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 09:28:12", "author": "Nikhil Naz", "authors": ["Nikhil Naz"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.224}, {"id": 295590532, "title": "Meet Tanushka Singh, first woman pilot in Air Force's Jaguar squadron", "text": "Flying Officer Tanushka Singh has become the first woman pilot to be permanently assigned to the Indian Air Force\u2019s (IAF) Jaguar fighter jet squadron.

The deceased have been identified as Sajan Das (53) and Srija Das (22), residents of Rameswarpur in West Bengal's South 24 Parganas district.A police source told India Today TV that their enquiry found that Srija Das was autistic and had been under continuous medication since birth. \"It is suspected that Sajan Das was worried about his daughter's condition and felt burdened by the pressure of bearing her medical expenses since her birth,\" the police source added.Both Sajan and Srija Das were brought down after cutting the nylon rope tied to the iron hook of a ceiling fan, and subsequently taken to Kolkata's Vidyasagar State General Hospital, where they were declared \"brought dead\" at 1 am on March 1, by the on-duty medical officer, revealed police sources.Sajan Das, the father, used to earn his livelihood by selling and repairing chimneys and water purifiers at a rented workshop for the past three years at same site where the incident took place.A preliminary probe further revealed that on Friday, Sajan Das took his daughter to consult a doctor in Kolkata's SSKM Hospital. At 1:15 PM, he informed his wife that they had reached the hospital. However, after a few hours, when Sajan didn't respond to her repeated phone calls, the worried wife contacted a family friend and requested him to check on them. On arrival at Sajan's workshop, the friend, identified as Ranjit Kumar Singh, found the doors to be shut but not locked from inside. On opening the door, Singh saw the bodies hanging and immediately informed Sajan Das's wife.After being alerted to the tragic incident, officers from Parnashree Police Station rushed to the spot and recovered the bodies after completing the necessary formalities.A team from the Scientific Wing, including fingerprint experts and photographers from the detective department, was called to examine the crime scene and collect samples.The exact cause of death can only be determined after the inquest and the postmortem reports, the official said.Published By: Sayan GangulyPublished On: Mar 1, 2025Must Watch", "summary": "Father, daughter die by suicide in Kolkata; police link to autism, therapy costs", "url": "https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/man-daughter-found-hanging-in-kolkata-police-suspect-financial-distress-2687456-2025-03-01", "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202503/hang-081603345-16x9.jpg?VersionId=GM9bpDZukaR4kAhBDw1wUEN7ke4BQl.y?size=1280:720", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 09:33:18", "author": "Rajesh Saha", "authors": ["Rajesh Saha"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.651}, {"id": 295542736, "title": "Fewer beer breweries in Netherlands for first time in 15 years", "text": "For the first time in 15 years, there was a drop in the number of breweries in the Netherlands compared to the previous year. The Netherlands now has 740 breweries, which is 40 less than during the start of 2024. This was reported by Statistics Netherlands. Many small breweries quit operations due to the rise in costs, which makes beer production less profitable.\n\nThere were 75 breweries in the Netherlands in 2010, almost ten times less than now. This growth is mainly due to smaller breweries. Between 2010 and this year, there was an increase of 380 breweries that were run by one person. In addition, another 160 breweries that were run by two people were added, and 75 beer companies with three to five working people.\n\nThe turnover in the sector grew by just eight percent between 2016 and 2022 despite the significant rise in the number of breweries. Operation costs rose much harder during this time, by 26 percent.\n\nNoord-Brabant has the relatively highest amount of breweries, with 160 beer manufacturing locations. Noord-Holland (145 breweries), Zuid-Holland (110), and Gelderland (95) follow. The provinces with the fewest number of breweries are Flevoland, Groningen, and Zeeland.\n\nThe reduction in the number of breweries does not come as a surprise to Nederlandse Brouwers, the association for Dutch breweries. According to the association, the Netherlands has more breweries per person than traditional beer countries like Belgium and Germany.\n\n\"But if breweries have to close because they cannot survive financially due to high costs and sharply increased taxes, that is very sad. That is not a good development,\" the organization responded. They confirmed that it is mainly the smaller breweries that are struggling financially.", "summary": "For the first time in 15 years, there was a drop in the number of breweries in the Netherlands compared to the previous year.", "url": "https://nltimes.nl/2025/03/01/fewer-beer-breweries-netherlands-first-time-15-years", "image": "https://nltimes.nl/sites/nltimes.nl/files/styles/news_article_full_desktop_2x/public/2021-09/Depositphotos_150393574_l-2015.jpg?h=2e5cdddf", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-03-01 00:00:00", "author": "78666,Nl Times", "authors": ["78666", "Nl Times"], "language": "en", "source_country": "nl", "sentiment": -0.352}, {"id": 295590498, "title": "Norwegian skier Kristoffersen leads Swiss star Odermatt in World Cup GS after opening run - The Associated Press", "text": "Your Opt Out Preference Signal is Honored\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\nTo provide you with a more personalized and better-performing online experience, our site uses tracking technologies, including cookies, to collect information that may relate to you, your preferences, and your device.
